# Introducing the Visual Studio Code Private Marketplace: Your Team's Secure, Curated Extension Hub 🎉

November 18, 2025 by [Sean Iyer](https://x.com/nuget)

Developers shouldn't have to juggle manual installs, worry about unverified extensions, or chase compliance exceptions just to get their favorite tools. Today, we're excited to announce Private Marketplace for VS Code—a dedicated, enterprise-ready hub that puts you in full control of how extensions are sourced, reviewed, and distributed to your dev teams. 🔐✨

## With the Private Marketplace, you can:

- Curate exactly which extensions appear for your organization, whether they're internal tools or trusted public plugins.
- Lock down sensitive IP by privately hosting your own extensions—no more sharing proprietary code outside your firewall.
- Easily rehost vetted public extensions after your own checks, so your teams can use familiar tools in secure or air-gapped environments.
- Roll out everything centrally—new users get a consistent, up-to-date catalog from day one.

## Same great VS Code experience

Fully integrated into the VS Code experience, your developers will find, install, and update extensions as easily as ever—without leaving the safety of your managed ecosystem. No more ticket-based installs, zip file confusion, or security compromises.
