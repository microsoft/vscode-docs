# Agent sessions, A planning agent and OpenAI Codex Integration: A Universe Recap

VS Code releases 11 times a year. That's a release every _single_ month.  And all of those releases culminate each year with our announcements at GitHub Universe. Last year, we announced that Claude was being added to Copilot and a new chat mode called "Edits" that would both answer your chat questions AND write code. What a time to be alive!

Fast forward 12 months to GitHub Universe 2025 and the Copilot experience in VS Code is virtually unrecognizable from where it was just a year ago. If you haven't seen Copilot in the past year, you haven't seen it at all.

So let's take a look at some of the biggest announcements from Universe 2025, and how we have transformed the Copilot experience in VS Code over the past year.

## Agent Sessions

If we were picking the official word for 2025, it would definitely be "agent". Naming things is definitely hard and that word has taken on a lot of different meanings, but in the past year we've come to understand agents as autonomous collaborators that can break work down into steps, use tools and API's, and iterate on their work until they reach a goal. There are a lot of agents out there - including Copilot in VS Code, Copilot Coding Agent in the cloud, and the recently released GitHub Copilot CLI.

But there are other agents too. Ones whose names don't include the word "Copilot". 😉

This year at GitHub Universe, we had some major announcements both in VS Code and in GitHub with the instroduction of "Agent HQ".

In this post, we'll take a look at these big agent announcements from Universe 2025 and how we are moving from a single Copilot experience to a full agent ecosystem.

And there's no better place to start than with what was one of the breakout agent stars of 2025 - OpenAI Codex.

### OpenAI Codex Integration

There was no shortage of coding agents released this year. There are literally dozens to choose from and many of them are incredibly capable. This is _great_ for developers. Choice is paramount and the intense agent competition means that coding agents are improving at a remarkable pace. But it's also led to a lot of fragmentation in the agent ecosystem. Developers are often forced to choose between multiple subscriptions and tools to get their work done. This causes a lot of "subscription hopping" and wondering if you're missing out because you aren't using "fill in the blank" new agent that everyone is raving about and using to build their side project which is earning 100K passive MMR what are you even doing with your life.

It shouldn't have to be this way. Ideally, developers should be able to seamlessly switch between any agent they want to use without needing to manage multiple accounts, subscriptions, or tools.

That's why we are so excited about the OpenAI Codex integration announced at GitHub Universe 2025.

OpenAI Codex was a **huge** hit with developers in 2025. Coming on the back of the highly capable GPT-5 model and the subsequent GPT-5 Codex model, OpenAI delivered a top tier agent development experience with the Codex CLI. They also have a _fantastic_ VS Code extension that allows you to get the Codex agent experience directly in the editor.

And this year at GitHub Universe, we announced that you can now use OpenAI Codex with your GitHub Copilot Pro+ login.

To light up this integration, all you need to do is install the OpenAI Codex extension and sign in with your GitHub Copilot Pro+ account. That's it. Full access to Codex, no additional subscription required.

When you use Codex via your Copilot Pro+ account, Copilot is used for all the model calls and the standard Copilot rate limits and billing apply. This means you can use Codex for code generation, code explanation, and all the other great features it provides without needing to manage a separate OpenAI account or subscription.

This is a huge step forward in unifying the agent ecosystem. Developers can now choose between multiple top-tier coding agents - Copilot and Codex - all within the same subscription and experience.
