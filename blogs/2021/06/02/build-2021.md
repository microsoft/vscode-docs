# Visual Studio Code at Build 2021

June 2, 2021 by Alessandro Segala, [@ItalyPaleAle](https://twitter.com/ItalyPaleAle)

> "That's a wrap! Now catch up with content on-demand."

[Build 2021](https://mybuild.microsoft.com/), Microsoft's main event for developers, ended last week. The Visual Studio Code team, alongside all our colleagues from Developer Division, worked really hard to deliver a lot of exciting content over the span of this two-day virtual event!

Even though Build is over, all the sessions are now available to watch on-demand. You can rewatch a live session, catch up with content you may have missed, or just learn something new; all conveniently at your own pace.

Among all the sessions that were presented, here is a hand-picked selection for you, VS Code users and developers, that we hope you'll enjoy!

## Find out what's new

### What's new in Visual Studio Code

Join Sana Ajani and Jeffrey Mew for some of the newest features of VS Code, including new debugging and testing features, custom notebooks, better support for Python, PyTorch, and Jupyter Notebooks.
