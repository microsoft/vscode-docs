# Install a Linux distro

You install WSL from the Windows Store. You can use the store app, or simply search for "Ubuntu" in the Windows' search bar. Choose the Linux distribution you want to install and follow the prompts.

Select **Install**.

![install Ubuntu](images/wsl/install-ubuntu.png)

And when done, select **Launch** to get started. This will open a Linux terminal and complete the installation.  You'll need to create a user ID and password since we're setting up a full Linux instance, but once that's done, boom! You are running Linux on Windows.
