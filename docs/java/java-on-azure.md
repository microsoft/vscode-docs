# Deploy Java to Azure

The [Azure Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-node-azure-pack) extension pack contains a rich set of extensions that make it easy to discover and interact with the cloud services that power your Java applications.

The extension pack supports the following development workflows:

* Deploy Java applications (including containers) to [Azure App Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/app-service).
* Deploy Spring microservices to [Azure Spring Cloud](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/spring-cloud/).
* Deploy serverless code to [Azure Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/functions).

If you are interested in a specific Azure service, you can also directly search for it on the [Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/VSCode) to see if there's an available extension.
