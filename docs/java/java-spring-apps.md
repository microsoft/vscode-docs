# Java on Azure Spring Apps

> **Note**: Azure Spring Apps is the new name for the Azure Spring Cloud service.

This tutorial shows you how to create a Java web application with Visual Studio Code. You'll learn how to run, debug, and edit the Java web app locally and then on a fully managed Microservices platform built for Java workloads: [Azure Spring Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/spring-cloud/).

## Scenario

We will deploy a simple Spring Boot Getting Started web app to Azure Spring Apps.

Azure Spring Apps makes it easy to deploy Spring Boot microservice applications to Azure without any code changes. The service manages the infrastructure of Spring Apps applications so developers can focus on their code. Other benefits include:

* Efficiently migrate existing Spring apps and manage cloud scaling and costs.
* Modernize apps with Spring Apps patterns to improve agility and speed of delivery.
* Run Java at cloud scale and drive higher usage without complicated infrastructure.
* Develop and deploy rapidly without containerization dependencies.
* Monitor production workloads efficiently and effortlessly.

## Before you begin

Before running and deploying this sample, you must have the Java SE Development Kit (JDK) version 11 or above and Apache Maven build tools on your local development environment. If you don't already have them, install these tools first.

Download and install the [Extension Pack for Java](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack).

>**Note**: The `JAVA_HOME` environment variable must be set to the install location of the JDK to complete this tutorial.

Download Apache Maven version 3 or greater:

Install Apache Maven for your local development environment:

<a class="install-extension-btn" href="https://maven.apache.org/install" target="_blank" style="background-color:#68217A">Install Apache Maven</a>

## Download and test the Spring Boot app

Clone the [Spring Boot Getting Started](https://github.com/spring-guides/gs-spring-boot) sample project to your local machine. You can clone a Git repository with the **Git: Clone** command in the **Command Palette** (`kb(workbench.action.showCommands)`). Paste `https://github.com/spring-guides/gs-spring-boot.git` as the URL of the remote repository and then decide the parent directory under which to put the local repository. After that, open the `complete` folder within the cloned repository in VS Code by navigating to the folder and typing `code .`.

>**Note**: You can install Visual Studio Code from [https://code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and Git from [https://git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).

![Clone Spring Repository](images/java-webapp/clone-repository.gif)

From within VS Code, open any of the Java files within the `complete` folder (for example `src\main\java\hello\Application.java`). If you don't have the Java language extensions installed for VS Code, you will be prompted to install the Microsoft [Extension Pack for Java](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack). Follow the instructions and reload VS Code after the installation.

![Install Java Extensions](images/java-webapp/install-extensions.gif)

Once you have the Extension Pack for Java installed, it will automatically build the project for you (the build may take several minutes). You can run the application within VS Code by pressing `kb(workbench.action.debug.start)` and selecting the **Java** environment. The Java Debug extension will generate a debugging configuration file `launch.json` for you under a `.vscode` folder in your project. You can see build progress in the VS Code Status bar and when everything is finished, the final active debug configuration is displayed.

![debug configuration in the Status bar](images/java-webapp/debugging-status-bar.png)

You can learn more about how VS Code launches your application in Debugging [Launch Configurations](/docs/editor/debugging.md#launch-configurations). Press `kb(workbench.action.debug.start)` again to launch the debugger.

![Run Spring Boot](images/java-webapp/run-spring-boot.gif)

Test the web app by browsing to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) using a web browser. You should see the following message displayed: "Greetings from Spring Boot!".

![Greeting from Spring](images/java-webapp/greeting-from-spring.png)

## Make a change

Let's now edit `HelloController.java` to change "Greetings from Spring Boot!" to something else like "Hello World". VS Code provides a great editing experience for Java, check out [Editing and Navigating Code](/docs/languages/java.md#editing) to learn about VS Code's editing and code navigation features.

Select the **Restart** button on the top of the editor to relaunch the app and see result by reloading the browser.

![Restart Application](images/java-webapp/restart-application.png)

## Debug the application

Set a breakpoint (`kb(editor.debug.action.toggleBreakpoint)`) in the application source code, and reload your browser to hit the breakpoint.

Congratulations, you have your first Spring Boot web app running locally! Read on to learn how to host it in the cloud.

## Deploy to Azure Spring Apps

We just built a Java web application and ran it locally. Now you will learn how to deploy from Visual Studio Code and run it on [Azure Spring Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/spring-cloud/).

### Install the Azure Spring Apps extension

The [Azure Spring Apps](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-azurespringcloud) extension is used to create, manage, and deploy to Azure Spring Apps with key features including:

* Create/View/Delete apps in Azure Spring Apps
* Deploy Jar to the app
* Access the app with public/private endpoint
* Start, stop, and restart the app
* Scale the app in/out, up/down
* Config application settings such as environment variables and JVM options
* Stream logs from the app

To install the Azure Spring Apps extension, open the Extensions view (`kb(workbench.view.extensions)`) and search for `azure spring apps` to filter the results. Select the Microsoft [Azure Spring Apps](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-azurespringcloud) extension. For a command-line experience, you can also check out the [Azure Spring Apps quickstart with Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/spring-apps/quickstart).

### Sign in to your Azure subscription

The deploy process uses the [Azure Account](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.azure-account) extension (installed along with the Spring Cloud extension as a dependency) and you need to sign in with your Azure subscription.

If you don't have an Azure subscription, you can sign up for a [free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

<a class="install-extension-btn" href="https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/" target="_blank" style="background-color:#68217A">Create your free Azure account</a>

To sign in to Azure, run **Azure: Sign In** from the **Command Palette** (`kb(workbench.action.showCommands)`). You can then sign in to your account using the **Device Login** flow. Select **Copy & Open** to open your default browser.
