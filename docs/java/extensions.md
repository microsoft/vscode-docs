# Java Extensions for Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code provides many features as a Java language editor. You can also install VS Code extensions to add more features for Java development.

> **Tip:** To see how to install and manage your extensions, refer to the [extension documentation](/docs/editor/extension-gallery.md).

## Recommended extensions

To help set up Java on VS Code, there is the Microsoft [Java Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack) which contains these popular extensions:

1. [Language Support for Java(TM) by Red Hat](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.java)
2. [Debugger for Java](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-debug)
