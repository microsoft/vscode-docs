# Java extensions for Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code provides many features as a Java language editor. You can also install VS Code extensions to add more features for Java development.

> **Tip:** To learn how to install and manage your extensions, refer to the [extension documentation](/docs/editor/extension-marketplace.md).

Thanks to the great Java community around VS Code, you can search for a large number of Java extensions easily within VS Code:

1. Go to the **Extensions** view (`kb(workbench.view.extensions)`).
2. Filter the extensions list by typing "java".
