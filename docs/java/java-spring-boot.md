# Spring Boot in Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code is an ideal lightweight development environment for Spring Boot application developers and there are several useful VS Code extensions including:

* [Spring Boot Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Pivotal.vscode-spring-boot)
* [Spring Initializr](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-spring-initializr)
* [Spring Boot Dashboard](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-spring-boot-dashboard)

We recommend installing the [Spring Boot Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pivotal.vscode-boot-dev-pack) that includes all of the extensions above.

If you run into any issues when using the features below, you can contact us by [opening an issue](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-pack/issues).

## Prerequisites

To develop a Spring Boot application in Visual Studio Code, you need to install the following:

* [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://www.microsoft.com/openjdk)
* [Extension Pack for Java](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack)
* [Spring Boot Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pivotal.vscode-boot-dev-pack)

>**Note**: More information about how to get started can be found at [Getting Started with Java](/docs/java/java-tutorial.md) tutorial.

## Create the project

The [Spring Initializr](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-spring-initializr) extension allows you to search for dependencies and generate new Spring Boot projects.

To install, launch VS Code and from the Extensions view (`kb(workbench.view.extensions)`), search for `vscode-spring-initializr`.

Once you have the extension installed, open the **Command Palette** (`kb(workbench.action.showCommands)`) and type `Spring Initializr` to start generating a Maven or Gradle project and then follow the wizard.

## Edit the project

The [Spring Initializr](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-spring-initializr) extension allows you to add dependencies after generating a new Spring Boot project.

Navigate to your `pom.xml` file and right-click to select **Add starters...**. A dropdown will show the dependencies you already have beginning with a `âˆš` . You can search for other dependencies you want to add to your project. Or you can click on the existing dependencies to remove them.

## Develop the application

The [Spring Boot Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Pivotal.vscode-spring-boot) extension includes rich language support for working with Spring Boot `application.properties`, `application.yml`, and `.java` files.

The extension supports the following features:

* Quickly navigate to a Spring element in your workspace
* Smart code completion for Spring specific components
* Quick access to running Spring apps
* Live application information
* Code templates

Similar code completion and validation features are also available for `.properties` and `.yml` files.

To learn how to use these features, you can visit this [detailed usage guide](https://github.com/spring-projects/sts4/tree/main/vscode-extensions/vscode-spring-boot#usage).

Below is an example showing live application information.

## Run the application

In addition to using `kb(workbench.action.debug.start)` to run your application, there's the [Spring Boot Dashboard](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-spring-boot-dashboard) extension, which lets you view and manage all available Spring Boot projects in your workspace as well as quickly start, stop, or debug your project.
