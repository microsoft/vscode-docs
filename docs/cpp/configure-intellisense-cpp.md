# Configuring includePath for better IntelliSense results

This page describes how to configure include paths for folders containing C or C++ files to get the full IntelliSense experience. If you're seeing the following message when opening a folder in VS Code, it means the C++ IntelliSense engine needs additional information about the paths in which your include files are located.

## Where are the include paths defined?

The include paths are defined in the `includePath` setting in a file called `c_cpp_properties.json` located in the **.vscode** directory in the opened folder.

You can create or open this file by either using the `C/Cpp: Edit Configurations` command in the command palette or by selecting `Edit "includePath" setting` in the light bulb menu (see the screenshot below). The quickest way to locate a light bulb is to scroll to the top of the source file and click on any green squiggle that shows up under a #include statement.

 When a folder is opened, the extension attempts to locate your system headers based on your operating system, but it does not know about any other libraries that your project depends on. You can hover over the green squiggles or open the Problems window to understand which headers the IntelliSense engine is unable to open - sometimes it's the dependent headers that can't be located.

## How to specify the include paths?

You can specify the remaining paths using one of the techniques described below.

### Use `compile_commands.json` file to supply includePaths and defines information

The extension can get the information for `includePath` and `defines` from a **compile_commands.json** file, which can be autogenerated by many build systems such as CMake and Ninja. Look for the section where your current configuration is defined (by default there's one configuration per OS, such as "Win32 or "Mac"), and set the `compileCommands` property in `c_cpp_properties.json` to the full path to your **compile_commands.json** file and the extension will use that instead of the `includes` and `defines` properties for IntelliSense.

### Use the light bulb suggestions to autoresolve includePath

The first thing to try is to leverage the light bulb path suggestions to autoresolve the include paths. When you open a folder, the extension will recursively search for potential include paths that match the header files your code is using based on the paths set by the `browse.path` setting in `c_cpp_properties.json`. Click on the green squiggles under #include statements and you'll see a light bulb offering suggestions of paths that will allow IntelliSense to resolve the included file.

If you don't see path suggestions in the light bulb, try adding the root folder where the headers are likely located in to the `browse.path` setting in `c_cpp_properties.json`. This allows the extension to **recursively** search in these folders and offer more suggestions in the light bulb as the search process goes on.

### Manually add include paths

If none of the above fully resolves the paths, you could manually specify the paths to the headers that your project depends on in the `c_cpp_properties.json` file.  Look for the section where your current configuration is defined (by default there's one configuration per OS, such as "Win32 or "Mac"), and add your paths in the `includePath` setting and defines in the `defines` setting. For example, the following screenshot shows a snippet of the file specifying path for the Mac configuration.

## Verify the include paths are correctly resolved

There are two ways to verify that the include paths are correctly resolved:

1. The green squiggles in the source file are no longer showing
2. Error messages are cleared in the Problems window

This indicates that the IntelliSense engine has got the include paths resolved so you can start enjoying the full IntelliSense for your C or C++ code for the current translation unit. You may still see errors on other files if they belong to a different translation unit that requires additional include paths to be configured.
