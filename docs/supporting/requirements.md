# Requirements for Visual Studio Code

## Hardware

Visual Studio Code is a small download (< 200 MB) and has a disk footprint of < 500 MB. VS Code is lightweight and should easily run on today's hardware.

We recommend:

* 1.6 GHz or faster processor
* 1 GB of RAM

## Platforms

VS Code is supported on the following platforms:

* OS X El Capitan (10.11+)
* Windows 8.0, 8.1 and 10, 11 (32-bit and 64-bit)
* Linux (Debian): Ubuntu Desktop 16.04, Debian 9
* Linux (Red Hat): Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, CentOS 7, Fedora 34

## Not supported

* VS Code does not support application virtualization solutions such as Microsoft App-V or MSIX for Windows, or third-party app virtualization technologies.
* Running VS Code in a virtual machine environment requires a full operating system.
* VS Code does not support multiple simultaneous users using the software on the same machine, including shared virtual desktop infrastructure machines or a pooled Windows/Linux Virtual Desktop host pool.
* Running the full VS Code in Windows/Linux containers is not supported but running with the [Dev Containers](/docs/devcontainers/containers.md) extension is supported. When using the Dev Containers extension, the VS Code server is running in the container while the VS Code client is on the desktop.

### Additional Linux requirements

* GLIBCXX version 3.4.21 or later
* GLIBC version 2.17 or later

For a list of currently known issues, see our [FAQ](faq).
