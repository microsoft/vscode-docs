# Requirements for Visual Studio Code

## Hardware

Visual Studio Code is a small download (< 100 MB) and has a disk footprint of 200 MB. VS Code is lightweight and should easily run on today's hardware.

We recommend:

* 1.6 GHz or faster processor
* 1 GB of RAM

## Platforms

VS Code has been tested on the following platforms:

* OS X Yosemite
* Windows 7 (with .NET Framework 4.5.2), 8.0, 8.1 and 10 (32-bit and 64-bit)
* Linux (Debian): Ubuntu Desktop 14.04, Debian 7
* Linux (Red Hat): Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, CentOS 7, Fedora 23

### Additional Windows requirements

.NET Framework 4.5.2 is required for VS Code.  If you are using Windows 7, please make sure [.NET Framework 4.5.2](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=42643) is installed.

### Additional Linux requirements

* GLIBCXX version 3.4.15 or later
* GLIBC version 2.15 or later
