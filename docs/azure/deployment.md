# Deploying Applications to Azure

Visual Studio Code makes it easy to deploy your applications to the cloud with [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com) and we've created walkthroughs to help you get started.

Whether your workflow is through the [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure) or [Azure App Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/app-service), using a Docker container, or creating serverless [Azure Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/functions/), you'll find the deployment steps you need.

## Deployment tutorials

These tutorials from Microsoft Learn describe different ways of creating and deploying apps to Azure via Visual Studio Code:

Tutorial | Description
--- | ---
[Deploy Azure Functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/javascript/tutorial/azure-function-cosmos-db-mongo-api) | Build and manage Azure Functions serverless apps directly in VS Code with the Azure Functions extension.
[Deploy using the App Service extension](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/tutorial-nodejs-mongodb-app) | Manage Azure resources directly in VS Code with the Azure App Service extension.
[Deploy using Docker](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/javascript/tutorial/tutorial-vscode-docker-node/tutorial-vscode-docker-node-01) | Deploy your website using a Docker container.
[Deploy a static website](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/static-web-apps/getting-started) | Create, deploy, and update a static website.

You can find additional tutorials and walkthroughs on the
[Azure Developer Center](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer), including language-specific articles for JavaScript and Node.js, Python, Java, and .NET.
