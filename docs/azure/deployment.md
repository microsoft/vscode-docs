# Deploying Applications to Azure

Visual Studio Code makes it easy to deploy your applications to the cloud with [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com) and we've created walkthroughs to help you get started.

Whether your workflow is through the [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure) or [Azure App Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/app-service), using a Docker container, or creating serverless [Azure Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/functions/), you'll find the deployment steps you need.

## Deployment tutorials

The tutorials and topics below describe different ways of creating and deploying apps to Azure via Visual Studio Code:

Tutorial(s) | Description | Framework / Language
--- | --- | ---
[Deploy a static website](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/static-web-apps/getting-started) | Create, deploy, and update a static website | Angular, Blazor, React, or Vue
[Deploy Node.js apps](/docs/nodejs/nodejs-deployment.md) | Deploy web apps, containerized apps, or serverless code | Node.js
[Deploy Python apps](/docs/python/python-on-azure.md) | Deploy web apps, containerized apps, or serverless code | Python
[Deploy Java apps](/docs/java/java-on-azure.md) | Deploy web apps, Spring Boot apps, or serverless code | Java

You can find additional tutorials and walkthroughs on the
[Azure Developer Center](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer), including language-specific articles for JavaScript and Node.js, Python, Java, and .NET.
