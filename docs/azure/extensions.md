# Azure Extensions

You can use [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com) directly from Visual Studio Code through extensions. Using either the [Azure CLI](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.azurecli) or the [Azure App Service](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azureappservice) extension, you can have your application running in Azure in minutes.

## Visual Studio Code Marketplace

There are many VS Code extensions on the [Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?term=azure&target=VSCode&category=All%20categories&sortBy=Relevance) that make it easy to build and host applications on Azure.

There is also a [Node Pack for Azure](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-node-azure-pack) extension pack which bundles useful Azure extensions for Node.js developers into a single installation.

## Searching for extensions

You can also search for Azure or cloud extensions in the VS Code Extensions view (`kb(workbench.view.extensions)`) and type 'azure'.
