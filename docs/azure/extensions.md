# Azure Extensions

You can use [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com) directly from Visual Studio Code through extensions. Using either the [Azure CLI](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.azurecli) or the various extensions in the [Azure Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-node-azure-pack) extension pack, you can have your application running in Azure in minutes.

## Visual Studio Code Marketplace

There are many VS Code extensions on the [Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?term=azure&target=VSCode&category=All%20categories&sortBy=Relevance) that make it easy to build and host applications on Azure.
