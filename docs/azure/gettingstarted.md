# Productivity guide for Azure Tools

.....

## Get started

**Search with the Command Palette.** The most important key combination to know is Ctrl+Shift+P because it brings up the Command Palette. It is your starting point for access to all functionality within VS Code including commands, keyboard shortcuts, and opening files.

**Open folders.** A Visual Studio Code *workspace* is the collection of one or more folders that are opened in a VS Code window (instance). In most cases, you will have a single folder opened as the workspace. You can open a workspace by using the **File > Open Folder...** menu, and then selecting a folder. However, depending on your development workflow, you can include more than one folder, using an advanced configuration called Multi-root workspace.

**Review settings.** To edit or review your current settings in VS Code, use Ctrl+, to open Settings.

**Identify and customize keyboard shortcuts.** Find the list of all the assigned [VS Code shortcuts](https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-windows.pdf).

**Redisplay notifications.** You can right-click the bell icon in the bottom right of the Status Bar in VS Code to see missed notifications.

**Make VS Code more accessible.** VS Code has built-in accessibility features that are compatible with screen readers and other assistive technologies. See [Accessibility](/docs/editor/accessibility.md) for the full list of available features.

## Write Code

**Resource and Workspace views** Use the Resources explorer to create and manage Azure resources. Use the Workspace explorer to create files and deploy.

**Grouping** Change the way resources are grouped to fit your workflow.

**Create Resources** Create an Azure resource from your installed extensions directly in VS Code.

## Troubleshooting

**Find logs.** The Output Channel displays textual information such as logs, messages, and other information. Use Ctrl+Shift+U to show Output.

**Tip:** More verbose log info is found in the Output Channel.

**Access resources.** View all of your recent activities and quickly access resources you've recently created in the **Activity Log**.
