# Azure Tools FAQ

This guide is specifically designed for Azure Tools within VS Code. It provides essential tips for getting started, writing code, deploying applications, troubleshooting with logs, utilizing Azure resources, and effectively navigating your code within VS Code.

## Get started

Streamline your workflow by quickly searching for commands, settings, and keyboard shortcuts, eliminating the need to navigate through multiple menus.

**Search with the Command Palette.** The most important key combination to know is Ctrl+Shift+P because it brings up the Command Palette. It is your starting point for access to all functionality within VS Code including commands, keyboard shortcuts, and opening files.

**Open folders.** A Visual Studio Code *workspace* is the collection of one or more folders that are opened in a VS Code window (instance). In most cases, you will have a single folder opened as the workspace. You can open a workspace by using the **File > Open Folder...** menu, and then selecting a folder. However, depending on your development workflow, you can include more than one folder, using an advanced configuration called Multi-root workspace.

**Review settings.** To edit or review your current settings in VS Code, use Ctrl+, to open Settings. It is helpful to review settings that any of the extensions may contribute.

**Identify and customize keyboard shortcuts.** Find the list of all the assigned [VS Code shortcuts](https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-windows.pdf).

**Redisplay notifications.** You can right-click the bell icon in the bottom right of the Status Bar in VS Code to see missed notifications.

**Make VS Code more accessible.** VS Code has built-in accessibility features that are compatible with screen readers and other assistive technologies. See [Accessibility](/docs/editor/accessibility.md) for the full list of available features.

## Write Code

Save time with these features: efficiently create and manage Azure resources, organize files and deploy easier, customize to align with your workflow, and seamlessly create Azure resources from installed extensions directly within VS Code.

**Resource and Workspace views** Use the Resources explorer to create and manage Azure resources. Use the Workspace explorer to create files and deploy.

**Grouping** Change the way resources are grouped to fit your workflow.

**Create Resources** Create an Azure resource from your installed extensions directly in VS Code.

## Troubleshooting

Quickly locate and review detailed log information, access your recent activities, and easily manage the resources you've recently created.

**Find logs.** The Output Channel displays textual information such as logs, messages, and other information. Use Ctrl+Shift+U to show Output.

**Tip:** More verbose log info is found in the Output Channel.

**Access resources.** View all of your recent activities and quickly access resources you've recently created in the **Activity Log**.
