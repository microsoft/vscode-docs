# Navigate and Edit

The navigation and editing tools described in this overview are enabled by the [C# Dev Kit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csdevkit) extension, a lightweight extension to enhance your C# development experience in Visual Studio Code.

## Code Navigation

With the [Outline view](/docs/getstarted/userinterface.md#outline-view), you can conveniently navigate the members within the current file. Installing the C# Dev Kit extension also gives you the [Solution Explorer view](/docs/csharp/project-management.md). This view helps you add, manage, and modify your projects contained within a larger solution without switching between the command line and the editor.

## Go To Definition

The **Go To Definition** feature navigates to the source or file of a type or member, and opens the result in a new tab. If you are a keyboard user, place your text cursor somewhere inside the symbol name and press `kb(editor.action.revealDefinition)`. If you are a mouse user, either right-click the symbol name and select **Go To Definition** from the context menu or `kbstyle(Ctrl+click)` the symbol name.  You can also use `kbstyle(Ctrl+Alt+click)` to open the definition on the side.

## Peek Definition

You can take a quick look at how a symbol was defined by using the **Peek Definition** feature. This feature displays a few lines of code near the definition inside a peek window, so you can take a look without navigating away from your current location.

To peek at a symbol's definition, place your cursor on the symbol anywhere it's used in your source code and then press `kb(editor.action.peekDefinition)`. Alternatively, you can choose **Peek Definition** from the context menu (right-click, then choose **Peek > Peek Definition**).

## Peek Implementations

You can take a quick, inline view at how and where a class, method, or symbol was implemented using the **Peek Implementations** feature.

To view the list of implementation locations, place the cursor on the symbol anywhere it's used in your source code and then press `kb(editor.action.peekImplementation)`.  Alternatively, you can choose **Peek Implementations** from the context menu (right-click, then choose **Peek > Peek Implementations**).

## Peek References

You can get an inline list of sources where a selected symbol has been referenced in your code using the **Peek References** feature.  Place the cursor on the symbol anywhere it's used in your source code, right-click, then choose **Peek > Peek References**.

## Collapse or expand code snippets

To better view the source code, hover over the editor gutter to collapse or expand code snippets using the caret that appears.

## Smart selection

With [smart selection](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_33#_smart-select-api) (semantic selection), you can expand or shrink the selection range based on the semantic information of the caret position in your source code.

* To expand the selection, use `kb(editor.action.smartSelect.expand)`
* To shrink the selection, use `kb(editor.action.smartSelect.shrink)`
