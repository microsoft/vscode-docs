# Formatting and Linting

You can format your C# source code using the [C# Dev Kit extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csdevkit), a lightweight extension to enhance your C# development experience in Visual Studio Code.

Navigate to **File > Preferences > Settings** (`kb(workbench.action.openSettings)`) to customize how your `.cs` files are formatted.  The Settings editor gives you a list of different formatting options (particularly under **Commonly Used** and **Text Editor**) that you can adjust across your specific workspace or your entire user profile.

## How to support EditorConfig with C# Dev Kit

**EditorConfig (.editorconfig) files** are supported with the [EditorConfig for VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig), letting you customize formatting options in your C# project.  These files are also used to override the user/workspace settings with the settings you specify in them.
