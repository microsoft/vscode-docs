# AI Toolkit for Visual Studio Code

## What's AI Toolkit for Visual Studio Code?

AI Toolkit for Visual Studio Code is an extension to help developers and AI engineers to easily build AI apps through developing and testing with generative AI models locally or in the cloud. AI Toolkit supports most genAI models on the market.

AI engineers can use AI Toolkit to discover and try popular AI models easily with playground that has attachment support, run multiple prompts in batch mode, evaluate the prompts in a dataset to AI models for the popular evaluators, and finetune/deploy AI models.

## Who shall use AI Toolkit?

Any developer who wants to explore, test, evaluate, and finetune generative AI models when building AI apps.

## Install and setup

Search the Visual Studio Code extension marketplace for "AI Toolkit" and <a class="install-extension-btn" href="vscode:extension/ms-windows-ai-studio.windows-ai-studio">install the AI Toolkit for VS Code</a>
