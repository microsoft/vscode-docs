# AI Toolkit for Visual Studio Code


AI Toolkit for Visual Studio Code is an extension to help developers and AI engineers to easily build AI apps through developing and testing with generative AI models locally or in the cloud. AI Toolkit supports most genAI models on the market.

AI engineers can use AI Toolkit to discover and try popular AI models easily with playground that has attachment support, run multiple prompts in batch mode, evaluate the prompts in a dataset to AI models for the popular evaluators, and finetune/deploy AI models.

## Key features

- [Model catalog](/docs/intelligentapps/models.md) with rich generative AI models sources (GitHub, ONNX, OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, ...)
- [Bring Your Own Models](/docs/intelligentapps/models.md#bring-your-own-models) from remotely hosted model, or Ollama models that are running locally
- [Playground](/docs/intelligentapps/playground.md) for model inference or testing via chat
- Attachment support for multi-modal language models
- [Batch run prompts](/docs/intelligentapps/bulkrun.md) for selected AI models
- [Evaluate an AI model with a dataset](/docs/intelligentapps/evaluation.md) for supported popular evaluators like F1 score, relevance, similarity, coherence, and more
## Who should use AI Toolkit?

Any developer who wants to explore, test, evaluate, and finetune generative AI models when building AI apps.

## Install and setup

You can install the AI Toolkit from the Extensions view in VS Code:

> <a class="install-extension-btn" href="vscode:extension/ms-windows-ai-studio.windows-ai-studio">Install the AI Toolkit for VS Code</a>

You can switch the installation between the formal released version for stable features and pre-released version for early access of new features. Check What's New during the installation for detailed feature list of each version.
