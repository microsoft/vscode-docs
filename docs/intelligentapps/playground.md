# AI Toolkit playground

    From the chat input box, you can also clear chat history or add attachments for the prompt.

## Add attachments for multi-modal models

Multi-modal models are models that can process multiple types of input, such as text, images, audio, or video. By attaching files to your chat prompt, you can ask questions about the contents of these files.

For the models that support attachments, the attachment icon (paperclip) will show in the chat input box. Select the icon, and follow the instructions to attach one or more local files and use them with your prompt.
