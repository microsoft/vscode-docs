# Visual Studio Code on Raspberry Pi

Although it's not officially supported, you can run Visual Studio Code on [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org) devices.

By downloading and using Visual Studio Code, you agree to the [license terms](https://code.visualstudio.com/license) and [privacy statement](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=528096&clcid=0x409).

## Installation

Visual Studio Code is officially distributed via the [Raspberry Pi OS](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/operating-systems) (previously called Raspbian) APT repository, in both 32-bit and 64-bit variants.

You can install it by running:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install code
```

### Running VS Code

After installing the VS Code package, you can run VS Code by typing `code` in a terminal or launching it via the **Programming** menu.

## Updates

Your Raspberry Pi should handle updating VS Code in the same way as other packages on the system:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade code
```

You can always check when a new release is available in our [Updates](/updates) page.

## System requirements

VS Code is not officially supported on Raspberry Pi. Check our [community discussions](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-discussions/discussions/2379) for information on platforms that are known to work.
