# Python in a container

In this guide you will learn how to:

- Create a `Dockerfile` file describing a simple Python container.
- Build, run, and verify the functionality of a [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x), or General Python app.
- Debug the app running in a container.

## Prerequisites

- Docker Desktop and the VS Code Docker extension must be installed as described in the [overview](/docs/containers/overview.md#installation).
- For Python development, complete all [Getting started with Python](/docs/python/python-tutorial.md) steps
- A runnable Python application

### Create a Python project

If you don't have a Python project already, follow these commands sequentially from the terminal:

```bash
pip install django
django-admin startproject helloworld
cd helloworld
code .
```

If you want to containerize a complete Django or Flask web app, you can use one of the following samples:

- [python-sample-vscode-django-tutorial](https://github.com/microsoft/python-sample-vscode-django-tutorial/tree/tutorial), which is the result of following the [Django Tutorial](/docs/python/tutorial-django.md)

- [python-sample-vscode-flask-tutorial](https://github.com/microsoft/python-sample-vscode-flask-tutorial/tree/tutorial), which is the result of following the [Flask Tutorial](/docs/python/tutorial-flask.md)

After verifying your app runs properly, you can now Dockerize your application.

## Add Docker files to the project

1. Open the project folder in VS Code.
1. Open the Command Palette (`kb(workbench.action.showCommands)`) and use the **Docker: Add Docker Files to Workspace...** command:

    ![Add Dockerfile to a Python project](images/quickstarts/python-add-python.png)

1. When the prompt appears, select **Python: Django**, **Python: Flask**, or **Python: General** as the app type. For this tutorial, we will select **Python: Django**.

1. Enter the relative path to the app's entry point. This excludes the workspace folder you start from. According to [official Django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/intro/tutorial01/#creating-a-project), this path is commonly `manage.py` (root folder) or `subfolder_name/manage.py`. According to [official Flask documentation](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/api/), this is the path to where you create your Flask instance.

    >**Tip**: You may also enter the path to a folder name as long as this folder includes a `__main__.py` file.

1. If **Python: Django** or **Python: Flask** was selected, specify app port for local development. Django defaults to port 8000, while Flask defaults to port 5000; however, any unused port will work. We recommend selecting port 1024 or above to mitigate security concerns from [running as a root user](/docs/containers/python-configure-containers.md).

1. Select either **Yes** or **No** when prompted to include [Docker Compose](/docs/containers/docker-compose.md) files. If you select **Yes**, you will need to [verify the path](/docs/containers/quickstart-python.md#django-apps) to your `wsgi.py` file in the `Dockerfile` to run the **Compose Up** command successfully. Compose is typically used when running multiple containers at once.

1. With all of this information, the Docker extension creates the following files:

    - A `Dockerfile`. To learn more about IntelliSense in this file, refer to the [overview](/docs/containers/overview.md).

    - A `.dockerignore` file to reduce the image size by excluding files and folders that aren't needed such as `.git`, `.vscode`, and `__pycache__`.

    - If Docker Compose was selected, a `docker-compose.yml`  and `docker-compose.debug.yml` file.

    - If one does not already exist, a `requirements.txt` file for capturing all app dependencies.
    > **Important note**: To use our setup, the Python framework (Django/Flask) and Gunicorn **must be included** in the `requirements.txt` file. If the virtual environment/host machine already has these prerequisites installed and is supposed to be identical to the container environment, ensure app dependencies are ported over by running `pip freeze > requirements.txt` in the terminal. **This will overwrite your current `requirements.txt` file.**

### Add an environment variable to the image

The Docker Extension helps you author Dockerfiles by using [IntelliSense](/docs/editor/intellisense.md) to provide auto-completions and contextual help. To see this feature in action:

1. Open the `Dockerfile`.
2. Underneath the `EXPOSE` statement, type `kb(editor.action.triggerSuggest)` to trigger IntelliSense and scroll to `ENV`.

    ![Adding environment variable to Dockerfile](images/quickstarts/python-edit-dockerfile.png)

3. Press `kbstyle(Tab)` or `kbstyle(Enter)` to complete the statement, then set the `key` to VAR1 and the `value` to 10.

## Gunicorn modifications for Django/Flask apps

To give Python Web Developers a great starting point, we chose to use [Gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/#docs) as the default web server. Since it is referenced in the default Dockerfile, it is included as a dependency in the `requirements.txt` file.

> **Note**: To use Gunicorn as your web server, it must be included in the `requirements.txt` file as an app dependency. It does not need to be installed in your virtual environment/host machine. The Gunicorn entry point is overridden locally if your app is run with **Python: Django** or **Python: Flask**.

### Django apps

To use Gunicorn, it must bind to an application callable (what the application server uses to communicate with your code) as an entry point. This callable is declared in the `wsgi.py` file of a Django application. To accomplish this binding, the final line in the Dockerfile says:

```docker
CMD ["gunicorn", "--bind", "0.0.0.0:8000", "{workspace_folder_name}.wsgi"]`
```

If your project does not follow Django's default project structure (that is, a workspace folder and a wsgi.py file within a subfolder named the same as the workspace) you must overwrite the Gunicorn entry point in the Dockerfile to locate the correct `wsgi.py` file.

  > **Tip**: If your `wsgi.py` file is in the root folder, the final argument in the command above will be `"wsgi"`. Within subfolders, the argument would be `"subfolder1_name.subfolder2_name.wsgi"`.

### Flask apps

To use Gunicorn, it must bind to an application callable (what the application server uses to communicate with your code) as an entry point. This callable corresponds with the **file location** and **variable name** of your created Flask instance. According to [official Flask Documentation](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/api/), users generally create a Flask instance in the main module or in the `__init__.py` file of their package in this manner:

```python
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__) # Flask instance named app
```

To accomplish this binding, the final line in the Dockerfile says:

```docker
CMD ["gunicorn", "--bind", "0.0.0.0:5000", "{subfolder}.{module_file}:app"]
```

During the **Docker: Add Docker Files to Workspace...** command, you configure the path to the Flask instance, however, the Docker extension assumes your Flask instance variable is named `app`. If this is not the case, you must change the variable name in the Dockerfile.

  > **Tip**: If your main module was in the root folder as a file named `main.py` and had a Flask instance variable was named `myapp`, the final argument in the command above will be `"main:myapp"`. Within subfolders, the argument would be `"subfolder1_name.subfolder2_name.main:myapp"`.

## Build, run, and debug the container

The **Docker: Add Docker Files to Workspace...** command automatically creates a Docker launch configuration to build and run your container in debug mode. To debug your Python app container:

1. Navigate to the `manage.py` file and set a breakpoint on this line:

    ```python
      os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'helloworld.settings')
    ```

    >**Note**: If you have created an app project as shown in the [Create a Django app](/docs/python/tutorial-django.md#create-a-django-app) section of the Django tutorial, you can also set a breakpoint in `views.py` or wherever you choose.

1. Navigate to **Run and Debug** and select **Docker: Python - Django**.

    ![Selected Docker debug configuration](images/quickstarts/python-debug-configuration.png)

1. Start debugging using the `kb(workbench.action.debug.start)` key.
    - The Docker image builds.
    - The Docker container runs.
    - The python debugger stops at the breakpoint in `manage.py`.

1. Step over this line once.
1. Navigate to the **Debug Console** and type `os.environ["DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE"]`
1. Once you view the output, press continue.

The Docker extension will launch your browser to a randomly mapped port:

  ![Django website launches](images/quickstarts/python-web-launch.png)

>**Tip**: To modify your Docker build settings, such as changing the image tag, navigate to `.vscode -> tasks.json` under the `dockerBuild` attribute in the `docker-build` task. Use IntelliSense within the file (`kb(editor.action.triggerSuggest)`) to display all other valid directives.

## Use the Docker Explorer

The Docker Explorer provides an interactive experience to examine and manage Docker assets such as containers, images, and so on. To see an example:

1. Navigate to the Docker Explorer.
1. In the **Containers** tab, right-click on your container and choose **View Logs**.

    ![Viewing the logs of a container](images/quickstarts/python-view-logs.png)

1. The output will be displayed in the terminal.
