# Docker Tools Tips and Tricks

This article covers troubleshooting tips and tricks for the Visual Studio Code [Docker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-docker) extension. See the [Overview](/docs/containers/overview.md) and quickstart articles for [Node.js](/docs/containers/quickstart-node.md), [Python](/docs/containers/python.md), or [ASP.NET](/docs/containers/quickstart-aspnet-core.md) for details on setting up and working with Docker.

## Error "connect EACCES /var/run/docker.sock" on Linux

Since VS Code runs as a non-root user, you will need to follow the steps in "Manage Docker as a non-root user" from [Post-installation steps for Linux](https://aka.ms/AA37yk6) to access Docker from the extension.

## Docker containers and images have disappeared from Docker view

This is most likely caused by a conflict with another extension called `Docker Explorer` (not authored by Microsoft).  To resolve this issue, use a workaround described [vscode-docker issue #1609](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docker/issues/1609#issuecomment-586331394).

## The extension does not find Docker on a remote machine

Error message "Failed to connect. Is Docker installed and running?"

1. Make sure Docker engine **is installed** on the remote machine and that Docker CLI works (run `docker ps` from the terminal and ensure it does not return any errors).
2. If you are using a remote development environment (remote machine via SSH, WSL subsystem, GitHub Codespace), make sure the Docker extension is installed remotely as well as locally.

## Invalid URL errors

If you have a need to connect to a remote Docker daemon, we recommend using Docker contexts instead of a `docker.host` attribute in the settings. Check out this guide to learn how to [create and use a context](https://docs.docker.com/engine/context/working-with-contexts/) to communicate with a remote Docker daemon.

If you still need to override the Docker context you are currently using, make sure your `DOCKER_HOST` environment variable or `docker.host` attribute includes a protocol in the URL (for example, `ssh://myuser@mymachine` or `tcp://1.2.3.4`).

> **Note:** Keep in mind that your `docker.host` attribute will override your Docker context and the `DOCKER_HOST` environment variable will override both the `docker.host` attribute and your Docker context.

> **Tip**: In Powershell you can change your Docker environment variable with `$ENV:DOCKER_HOST = 'ssh://username@1.2.3.4'`
