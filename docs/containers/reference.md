# Customize the Docker extension

The Docker extension includes several Visual Studio Code tasks to control the behavior of Docker [build](#docker-build-task) and [run](#docker-run-task), and form the basis of container startup for debugging.

The tasks allow for a great deal of control and customization. The final configuration is a combination of general defaults, platform-specific defaults (such as Node.js, Python, or .NET), and user input. User input takes precedence when it conflicts with defaults.

All common features of Visual Studio Code tasks (for example, grouping tasks into compound tasks) are supported by Docker extension tasks. For more information on common task features and properties, see the Visual Studio Code [custom task](/docs/editor/tasks.md#custom-tasks) documentation.

## Docker build task

The `docker-build` task builds Docker images using the Docker command line (CLI). The task can be used by itself, or as part of a chain of tasks to run and/or debug an application within a Docker container.

The most important configuration settings for the `docker-build` task are `dockerBuild` and `platform`:

- The `dockerBuild` object specifies parameters for the Docker build command. Values specified by this object are applied directly to Docker build CLI invocation.
- The `platform` property is a hint that changes how the `docker-build` task determines Docker build defaults.

See [property reference](#build-task-reference) for full list of all task properties.

### Platform support

While the `docker-build` task in `tasks.json` can be used to build any Docker image, the extension has explicit support (and simplified configuration) for Node.js, Python, and .NET Core.

### Node.js (docker-build)

**Minimal configuration using defaults**

A Node.js based Docker image with no specific platform options can just set the `platform` property to `node`:

```json
{
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "tasks": [
      {
          "label": "Build Node Image",
          "type": "docker-build",
          "platform": "node"
      }
  ]
}
```

**Platform defaults**

For Node.js Docker images, the `docker-build` task infers the following options:

| Property | Inferred Value |
| --- | --- |
| `dockerBuild.context` | The same directory in which the `package.json` resides. |
| `dockerBuild.dockerfile` | The file `Dockerfile` in the same directory as the `package.json` resides. |
| `dockerBuild.tag` | The application's `name` property in `package.json` (if defined), else the base name of the folder in which `package.json` resides. |

### Python (docker-build)

**Minimal configuration using defaults**

A Python based Docker image with no specific platform options can just set the `platform` property to `python`:

```json
{
  "tasks": [
      {
      "type": "docker-build",
      "label": "docker-build",
      "platform": "python"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Platform defaults**

For Python Docker images, the `docker-build` task infers the following options:

| Property | Inferred Value |
| --- | --- |
| `dockerBuild.context` | The default context is the workspace folder. |
| `dockerBuild.dockerfile` | The default `Dockerfile` path will be in the root of the workspace folder. |
| `dockerBuild.tag` | The base name of the root workspace folder. |
| `dockerBuild.pull` | Defaults to true in order to pull new base images before building. |

### .NET (docker-build)

**Minimal configuration using defaults**

When you build a .NET-based Docker image, you can omit the `platform` property and just set the `netCore` object (`platform` is implicitly set to `netcore` when `netCore` object is present). Note that `appProject` is a required property:

```json
{
    "version": "2.0.0",
    "tasks": [
        {
            "label": "Build Node Image",
            "type": "docker-build",
            "netCore": {
                "appProject": "${workspaceFolder}/project.csproj"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

**Platform defaults**

For .NET-based images, the `docker-build` task infers the following options:

| Property | Inferred Value |
| --- | --- |
| `dockerBuild.context` | The root workspace folder. |
| `dockerBuild.dockerfile` | The file `Dockerfile` in the root workspace folder. |
| `dockerBuild.tag` | The base name of the root workspace folder. |

| `appProject` | The .NET project file (`.csproj`, `.fsproj`, etc.) associated with the Dockerfile and `docker-build` task. <br/> Required always.  |

## Docker run task

The `docker-run` task in `tasks.json` creates and starts a Docker container using the Docker command line (CLI). The task can be used by itself, or as part of a chain of tasks to debug an application within a Docker container.

The most important configuration settings for the `docker-run` task are `dockerRun` and `platform`:

- The `dockerRun` object specifies parameters for the Docker run command. Values specified by this object are applied directly to Docker run CLI invocation.
- The `platform` property is a hint that changes how the `docker-run` task determines Docker run defaults.

See [property reference](#run-task-reference) for full list of all task properties.

## Docker Compose task

The `docker-compose` task in `tasks.json` creates and starts Docker containers using the Docker Compose command line (CLI). The task can be used by itself, or as part of a chain of tasks to debug an application within a Docker container.

The most important configuration setting for the `docker-compose` task is `dockerCompose`:

- The `dockerCompose` object specifies parameters for the Docker Compose command. Values specified by this object are applied directly to Docker Compose CLI invocation.

See [property reference](#compose-task-reference) for full list of all task properties.

**Example configuration**

```json
{
    "version": "2.0.0",
    "tasks": [
        {

            "type": "docker-compose",
            "dockerCompose": {
                "up": {

                    "build": true,
                    "services": [
                      "myservice"
                    ]
                },
                "files": [
                    "${workspaceFolder}/docker-compose.yml",
                    "${workspaceFolder}/docker-compose.debug.yml"
                ]
            }
        }

| `customOptions` | Any extra parameters to add after the `down` argument. No attempt is made to resolve conflicts with other options or validate this option. | (any) |

## Command customization

The Docker extension executes a number of Docker CLI commands when you perform various operations, such as to build images, run containers, attach to containers, and view container logs. Some of these commands have a large number of optional arguments, often used in very specific scenarios. Many of these commands can be customized.

For example, the tokens `${serviceList}` and `${profileList}` in the [Compose Up](#docker-compose-up) command allows for easily starting a subset of the services within your Docker Compose YAML file(s).

For each of these customizable Docker commands, a configuration setting is available to set the template of what to execute. Alternatively, you can define multiple templates, optionally with a regular expression, which when matched, hints the context in which a template should be used. The templates support some tokens similar to `launch.json` and `tasks.json`, for example, `${workspaceFolder}`.

### Settings JSON schema

You have two options for configuring each of the templates (listed below). The first option is a single template that overrides the default behavior:

```json
{
    "docker.commands.build": "docker build --rm -f \"${dockerfile}\" -t ${tag} \"${context}\""
}
```

The second option is multiple templates that will be chosen based on the `match` regular expression, as well as user input.

For example, three templates are shown in the following example:

```json
{
    "docker.commands.build": [
        {
            "label": "Default build command",
            "template": "docker build --rm -f \"${dockerfile}\" -t ${tag} \"${context}\""
        },
        {
            "label": "Alpine-specific build command",
            "template": "docker build -p 1234:1234 -f \"${dockerfile}\" -t ${tag} \"${context}\"",
            "match": "alpine"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Selection behavior

The command template chosen to execute is selected based on the following rules:

1. If no setting is configured, the default command template is chosen.
1. If only a single template is configured (the first example above), that template is chosen.
1. If multiple templates are configured:
    1. Constrained templates are checked. A constrained template has `match`. The `match` regular expression is compared against contextual hints--for example, image name, container name, etc.
    1. If multiple constrained templates apply, the user will be prompted to choose. If only one applies, the user will not be prompted.
    1. If there no applicable constrained templates, unconstrained templates are checked. An unconstrained template does not have `match`, and is therefore always applicable.
    1. If multiple unconstrained templates apply, the user will be prompted to choose. If only one applies, the user will not be prompted.

### Docker Build

| Configuration Setting | Default Value |
|--|--|
| `docker.commands.build` | `${containerCommand} build --rm -f "${dockerfile}" -t ${tag} "${context}"` |

Supported tokens:

| Token | Description |
| -- | -- |
| `${containerCommand}` | The CLI command / executable used to execute container commands. |
| `${dockerfile}` | The workspace-relative path of the selected `Dockerfile`. |
| `${tag}` | The value entered/confirmed by the user upon invoking the build command. If previously built, defaults to the previously entered value for that `Dockerfile`. |
| `${context}` | If set, the value of the `docker.imageBuildContextPath` configuration setting. Otherwise, the workspace-relative folder in which the `Dockerfile` resides. |

> **Note**: If the `docker.commands.build` setting does not contain the `${tag}` token, the user will **not** be prompted to enter/confirm a tag.

> **Note**: The `match` regular expression will be compared against the selected Dockerfile name and the workspace folder name.

### Docker Run

| Configuration Setting | Default Value |
|--|--|
| `docker.commands.run` | `${containerCommand} run --rm -d ${exposedPorts} ${tag}` |
| `docker.commands.runInteractive` | `${containerCommand} run --rm -it ${exposedPorts} ${tag}` |

Supported tokens:

| Token | Description |
| -- | -- |
| `${containerCommand}` | The CLI command / executable used to execute container commands. |
| `${exposedPorts}` | Generated from the list of exposed ports in the image (ultimately from the `Dockerfile`), where each exposed port is mapped to the same port on the local machine.  For example, `"EXPOSE 5000 5001"` would generate `"-p 5000:5000 -p 5001:5001"`. |
| `${tag}` | The full tag of the selected image. |

> **Note**: The `match` regular expression will be compared against the full tag of the selected image.

### Docker Attach

| Configuration Setting | Default Value |
|--|--|
| `docker.commands.attach` | `${containerCommand} exec -it ${containerId} ${shellCommand}`

Supported tokens:

| Token | Description |

| `${containerId}` | The ID of the container to attach to. |
| `${shellCommand}` | If `bash` is present in the container, it is substituted here, otherwise `sh`. In Windows containers, `cmd` is always used. |

> **Note**: The `match` regular expression will be compared against the container name and full tag of the container image.

### Docker Logs

| Configuration Setting | Default Value |
|--|--|
| `docker.commands.logs` | `${containerCommand} logs -f ${containerId}`

Supported tokens:

| Token | Description |
| -- | -- |
