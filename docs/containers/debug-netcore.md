# Debug .NET within a container

## Prerequisites

1. Install the [.NET SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download), which includes support for attaching to the .NET debugger.

1. Install the Visual Studio Code [C# extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csharp), which includes support for attaching to the .NET debugger with VS Code.

1. macOS users only: Add `/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/NuGetFallbackFolder` as a shared folder in your Docker preferences.

## Walkthrough

1. If needed, create a .NET project with `dotnet new`.
1. Open the project folder in VS Code.
1. Wait until a notification appears asking if you want to add required assets for debugging. Select **Yes**:

   ![csharpPrompt](images/debug/csharp-prompt.png)

1. Open the Command Palette (`kb(workbench.action.showCommands)`) and enter **Docker: Add Docker Files to Workspace...**. If you have already dockerized your app, you can instead do **Docker: Initialize for Docker debugging**. Follow the prompts.
1. Switch to the **Run and Debug** view (`kb(workbench.view.debug)`).
1. Select the **Docker .NET Core Launch** launch configuration.
1. Optionally, set a breakpoint.
1. Start debugging! (`kb(workbench.action.debug.start)`)

## Running and debugging with SSL support

To enable SSL (using the HTTPS protocol), you will need to make a few changes to your configuration.

1. In the Dockerfile, add an `EXPOSE` line to the base section to define a separate port for HTTPS / SSL. Keep a separate `EXPOSE` line with a different port for HTTP requests.

   ```docker
   FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:5.0 AS base
   WORKDIR /app
   EXPOSE 5000
   EXPOSE 5001
   ```

1. In the `.vscode/tasks.json` file, add `configureSsl: true` to the `netCore` section. Also, add an environment variable `ASPNETCORE_URLS` in the `dockerRun` section of the `docker-run: debug` task, with the same port numbers you defined in the Dockerfile:

   ```json
   dockerRun: {
       "env": {
          "ASPNETCORE_URLS": "https://+:5001;http://+:5000"
      }
    }
    netCore: {
        "appProject": "${workspacefolder}/MyProject.csproj",
        "enableDebugging": true,
        "configureSsl": true
    }
   ```

For additional customization options, see the documentation on [Tasks](/docs/containers/reference.md) and [Debug containerized apps](/docs/containers/debug-common.md).
