# Microsoft Fabric Extensions for Visual Studio Code

## Overview
Microsoft Fabric extensions for VS Code provide a powerful, integrated development experience for data engineers and developers working with Fabric artifacts, lakehouses, notebooks, and user data functions. These extensions streamline workflows by enabling local development, debugging, and workspace management directly within VS Code.

## What is Microsoft Fabric?
Microsoft Fabric is a unified data and analytics platform that combines the best of Power BI, Azure Synapse, and Data Factory into a single, integrated experience. It empowers organizations to manage, analyze, and visualize data across teams with ease—enabling faster insights, better collaboration, and more informed decision-making. Whether you're a data engineer, analyst, or business leader, Fabric simplifies your workflow and accelerates your data journey.
