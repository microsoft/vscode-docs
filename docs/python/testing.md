# Python testing in Visual Studio Code

The [Python extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) builds on the built-in [testing features in VS Code](/docs/debugtest/testing.md) and provides test discovery, test coverage, and running and debugging tests for Python's built-in [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html) framework and [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/).

## Configure tests

When the Python extension is installed and a Python file is open within the editor, a test beaker icon displays on the VS Code Activity Bar representing the **Test Explorer** view. Opening the Test Explorer shows a **Configure Python Tests** button if a test framework is not enabled. Selecting **Configure Python Tests** prompts you to select a test framework and a folder containing the tests. If you use unittest, you also select the file glob pattern used to identify your test files.

 > [!Note]
 > A file glob pattern is a defined string pattern that matches file or folder names based on wildcards to include or not include files.

![Configure Python Tests button displayed in the Test Explorer when tests haven't been configured.](images/testing/test-explorer-no-tests.png)

Tests can be configured anytime by using the **Python: Configure Tests** command from the [Command Palette](/docs/getstarted/userinterface.md#command-palette) or by setting either `python.testing.unittestEnabled` or `python.testing.pytestEnabled` in the Settings editor or `settings.json` file as described in the VS Code [Settings](/docs/configure/settings.md) documentation. Each framework also has specific configuration settings as described under [Test configuration settings](#test-configuration-settings) for their folders and patterns.

If you enable pytest and it is not currently installed in the activated environment, the Python extension attempts to install it in the background. Furthermore, if both frameworks are enabled, the Python extension only runs `pytest`.

> [!Note]
> The minimum supported version of pytest for the python extension is 7.0.0.

## Test discovery

By default, the Python extension attempts to discover tests once you enable a framework. You can trigger test discovery at any time using the **Test: Refresh Tests** command from the Command Palette.

> [!Tip]
> `python.testing.autoTestDiscoverOnSaveEnabled` is set to `true` by default, meaning that test discovery occurs automatically whenever you add, delete, or update any Python file in the workspace. To disable this feature, set the value to `false`, which can be done either in the Settings editor or in the `settings.json` file as described in the VS Code [Settings](/docs/getstarted/personalize-vscode.md#configure-settings) documentation. You need to reload the window for this setting to take effect. For more control over files included in auto test discovery, adjust the `python.testing.autoTestDiscoverOnSavePattern` setting, which defaults to `**/*.py`.

Test discovery applies the discovery patterns for the current framework (which can be customized using the [Test configuration settings](#test-configuration-settings)). The default behavior is as follows:

- `python.testing.unittestArgs`: Looks for any Python (`.py`) file with "test" in the name in the top-level project folder. All test files must be importable modules or packages. You can customize the file matching pattern with the `-p` configuration setting, and customize the folder with the `-t` setting.

- `python.testing.pytestArgs`: Looks for any Python (`.py`) file whose name begins with "test\_" or ends with "\_test", located anywhere within the current folder and all subfolders.

> [!Tip]
> Sometimes tests placed in subfolders aren't discovered because such test files cannot be imported. To make them importable, create an empty file named `__init__.py` in that folder.

If the test discovery succeeds, you'll see tests listed in the Test Explorer:

![The VS Code Test Explorer for Python tests](images/testing/test-explorer.png)

When triggering test discovery directly from the Test Explorer, you can also cancel an ongoing test discovery call. Use the **Cancel** button, which replaces the **Refresh** button during discovery.

![Cancel test discovery button in the Test Explorer.](images/testing/test-cancel-button.png)

If discovery fails (for example, the test framework isn't installed or you have a syntax error in your test file), you'll see an error message displayed in the Test Explorer including a link to the logs. You can check the **Python** output panel to see the entire error message (use the **View** > **Output** menu command to show the **Output** panel, then select **Python** from the dropdown on the right side).

![Discovery failure error messaged displayed in the Test Explorer](images/testing/test-discovery-error.png)

## Run tests

You can run tests using any of the following actions:

- With a test file open, select the green run icon that is displayed in the gutter next to the test definition line, as shown in the previous section. This command runs only that one method.

  ![Run test icon displayed on the gutter when the test file is open in the editor](images/testing/run-tests-gutter.png)

- From the Command Palette, by running any of the following commands:
  - **Test: Run All Tests** - Runs all tests that have been discovered.
  - **Test: Run Tests in Current File** - Runs all tests in a file that that is open in the editor.
  - **Test: Run Test at Cursor** - Runs only the test method under your cursor in the editor.

- From the **Test Explorer**:

  - To run all discovered tests, select the play button at the top of **Test Explorer**:

      ![Running all tests through Test Explorer](images/testing/test-explorer-run-all-tests.png)

  - To run a specific group of tests, or a single test, select the file, class, or test, then select the play button to the right of that item:

      ![Running tests at specific scopes through Test Explorer](images/testing/test-explorer-run-scoped-tests.png)

  - You can also run a selection of tests through the Test Explorer. To do that, `kbstyle(Ctrl+Click)` (or `kbstyle(Cmd+Click)` on macOS) on the tests you wish to run, right-click on one of them and then select **Run Test**.

After a test run, VS Code displays results directly in the editor as gutter decorations. Failed tests will also be highlighted in the editor, with a Peek View that displays the test run error message and a history of all of the tests' runs. You can press `kbstyle(Escape)` to dismiss the view, and you can disable it by opening the User settings (**Preferences: Open Settings (UI)** command in the **Command Palette**) and changing the value of the **Testing: Automatically Open Peek View** setting to `never`.

In the **Test Explorer**, results are shown for individual tests and any classes and files containing those tests. Folders will display a failure icon if any of the tests within that folder did not pass.

![Test results on a unittest class and in Test Explorer](images/testing/test-results.png)

VS Code also shows test results in the **Test Results** panel.

![Test results in the Test Results panel](images/testing/test-result-panel.png)

## Run tests with coverage

To run tests with coverage enabled, select the coverage run icon in the Test Explorer or the **Run with coverage** option from any menu you normally trigger test runs from. The Python extension runs coverage using the [`pytest-cov`](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-cov/) plugin if you are using pytest, or with [`coverage.py`](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/) for unittest.

> [!Note]
> Before running tests with coverage, make sure to install the correct testing coverage package for your project.
> Branch coverage is only supported on coverage versions >= 7.7.

Once the coverage run completes, lines are highlighted in the editor for line-level coverage. Test coverage results appear as a "Test Coverage" sub-tab in the Test Explorer, which you can also navigate to with **Testing: Focus on Test Coverage View** in the Command Palette (`kb(workbench.action.showCommands)`). On this panel, you can view line coverage metrics for each file and folder in your workspace, as well as branch coverage, if relevant.

![Gif showing running Python tests with coverage.](images/testing/python-coverage.gif)

For finer grain control of your coverage run when using pytest, you can edit the `python.testing.pytestArgs` setting to include your specifications. When the pytest argument `--cov` exists in `python.testing.pytestArgs`, the Python extension will make no additional edits to coverage args, to allow your customizations to take effect. If there is no `--cov` argument found, the extension will add `--cov=.` to the pytest args prior to run to enable coverage at the workspace root.

For more information on test coverage, visit VS Code's [Test Coverage documentation](/docs/debugtest/testing.md#test-coverage).

## Debug tests

To debug tests, right-click on the gutter decoration next to the function definition and select **Debug Test**, or select the **Debug Test** icon next to that test in the **Test Explorer**.

![Debug Test icon in the Test Explorer](images/testing/debug-test-in-explorer.png)

> [!Note]
> Running or debugging a test does not automatically save the test file. Always be sure to save changes to a test before running it, otherwise you'll likely be confused by the results because they still reflect the previous version of the file!

You can use the following commands from the Command Palette to debug tests:

- **Test: Debug All Tests** - Launches the debugger for all tests in your workspace.
- **Test: Debug Tests in Current File** - Launches the debugger for the tests you have defined in the file you have open in the editor.
- **Test: Debug Test at Cursor** - Launches the debugger only for the method where you have your cursor focused on the editor. You can also use the **Debug Test** icons in Test Explorer to launch the debugger for all tests in a selected scope and all discovered tests.

You can also change the default behavior of clicking on the gutter decoration to debug tests instead of run, by changing the `testing.defaultGutterClickAction` setting value to `debug` in your `settings.json` file.

The debugger works the same for tests as for other Python code, including breakpoints, variable inspection, and so on. To customize settings for debugging tests, you can specify test debug configs in either the `launch.json` or `settings.json` files in the `.vscode` folder from your workspace by adding the `"purpose": ["debug-test"]` to your config. This configuration will be used when you run **Test: Debug All Tests**, **Test: Debug Tests in Current File** and **Test: Debug Test at Cursor** commands.

For example, the configuration below in the `launch.json` file disables the `justMyCode` setting for debugging tests:

```json
{
    "name": "Python: Debug Tests",
    "type": "debugpy",
    "request": "launch",
    "program": "${file}",
    "purpose": ["debug-test"],
    "console": "integratedTerminal",
    "justMyCode": false
}
```

If you have more than one configuration entry with `"purpose": ["debug-test"]`, the first definition will be used since we currently don't support multiple definitions for this request type.

For more information on debugging or to understand how it works in VS Code, read the [Python debugging configurations](/docs/python/debugging.md) and general VS Code [Debugging](/docs/debugtest/debugging.md) articles.

## Run tests in parallel

Support for running tests in parallel with pytest is available through the `pytest-xdist` package. Visit their [documentation](https://pytest-xdist.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), for more information on how to use `pytest-xdist`.

When `xdist` is enabled and no worker count is specified in the arguments, the number of workers is automatically optimized by the Python extension based on how many tests are selected in the Test Explorer.

## Django unit tests

The Python extension also offers support for discovering and running Django unit tests! You can get your Django tests discovered with only a few additional setup steps:

1. Set `"python.testing.unittestEnabled": true,` in your `settings.json` [file](/docs/configure/settings.md).
2. Add `MANAGE_PY_PATH` as an environment variable:
    1. Create a `.env` file at the root of your project.
    2. Add `MANAGE_PY_PATH='<path-to-manage.py>'` to the `.env` file, replacing `<path-to-manage.py>` with the path to your application's `manage.py` file.
        > **Tip**: you can copy the path by right clicking on the file in the Explorer view and selecting **Copy Path**.
3. Add Django test arguments to `"python.testing.unittestArgs": []` in the `settings.json` [file](/docs/configure/settings.md) as needed, and remove any arguments that are not compatible with Django.

> [!Note]
> By default, the Python extension looks for and loads `.env` files at the project root. If your `.env` file is not at the project root or you are using [VS Code variable substitution](/docs/reference/variables-reference.md), add `"python.envFile": "${workspaceFolder}/<path-to-.env>"` to your `settings.json` [file](/docs/configure/settings.md). This enables the Python extension to load the environment variables from this file when running and discovering tests. Get more info about [Python environment variables](/docs/python/environments.md#environment-variables).

Navigate to the Testing view, and select the **Refresh Tests** button to have your Django tests displayed!

### Troubleshooting

If your Django unit tests are not showing in the Testing view, try the following troubleshooting steps:

- Search for error messages in the **Python** Output panel. They might provide a hint as to why your tests are not being discovered.
- Try to [run the Django tests in the terminal](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/testing/overview/#running-tests). Then "translate" the same command into VS Code settings.
    For example, if you run `python manage.py test --arg` in the terminal, you would add `MANAGE_PY_PATH='./manage.py'` to a `.env` file, and set `"python.testing.unittestArgs": [--arg]` in the VS Code settings. Alternatively, you can also find the commands that are run by the Python extension in the **Python** Output panel.
- Use the absolute path to the `manage.py` file when setting the `MANAGE_PY_PATH` environment variable, if you initially used the relative path.

## Test configuration settings

The behavior of testing with Python is driven by general UI settings provided by VS Code, and settings that are specific to Python and to whichever framework you've enabled.

### General UI settings

The settings that affect the UI of the testing features are provided by VS Code itself, and can be found in the [VS Code Settings editor](/docs/configure/settings.md) when you search for "Testing".

### General Python settings

| Setting<br/>(python.testing.) | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| autoTestDiscoverOnSaveEnabled | `true` | Specifies whether to enable or disable auto run test discovery when saving a test file. You may need to reload the window after making changes to this setting for it to be applied. |
| cwd | null | Specifies an optional working directory for tests. The presence of this setting dynamically adjusts the `--rootdir` argument for pytest. |
| autoTestDiscoverOnSavePattern | `**/*.py` | Specifies a glob pattern that determines which file changes trigger auto test discovery when `autoTestDiscoverOnSaveEnabled` is `true`. |
| debugPort | `3000` | Port number used for debugging of unittest tests. |
| promptToConfigure | `true` | Specifies whether VS Code prompts to configure a test framework if potential tests are discovered. |

### unittest configuration settings

| Unittest setting<br/>(python.testing.) | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| unittestEnabled | `false` | Specifies whether unittest is enabled as the test framework. The equivalent setting for pytest should be disabled. |
| unittestArgs | `["-v", "-s", ".", "-p", "*test*.py"]` | Arguments to pass to unittest, where each element that's separated by a space is a separate item in the list. See below for a description of the defaults. |

The default arguments for unittest are as follows:

- `-v` sets default verbosity. Remove this argument for simpler output.
- `-s .` specifies the starting directory for discovering tests. If you have tests in a "test" folder, change the argument to `-s test` (meaning `"-s", "test"` in the arguments array).
- `-p *test*.py` is the discovery pattern used to look for tests. In this case, it's any `.py` file that includes the word "test". If you name test files differently, such as appending "\_test" to every filename, then use a pattern like `*_test.py` in the appropriate argument of the array.

To stop a test run on the first failure, add the fail fast option `"-f"` to the arguments array.

See [unittest command-line interface](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#command-line-interface) for the full set of available options.

### pytest configuration settings

| pytest setting<br/>(python.testing.) | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| pytestEnabled | `false` | Specifies whether pytest is enabled as the test framework. The equivalent setting for unittest should be disabled. |
| pytestPath | `"pytest"` | Path to pytest. Use a full path if pytest is located outside the current environment. |
| pytestArgs | `[]` | Arguments to pass to pytest, where each element that's separated by a space is a separate item in the list. See [pytest command-line options](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/reference/reference.html#command-line-flags). |

The default arguments for pytest are as follows:

- `rootdir` is dynamically adjusted based on the presence of a `python.testing.cwd` setting in your workspace.

You can also configure pytest using a `pytest.ini` file as described on [pytest Configuration](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/reference/customize.html).

> [!Note]
> If you have the pytest-cov coverage module installed, VS Code doesn't stop at breakpoints while debugging because pytest-cov is using the same technique to access the source code being run. To prevent this behavior, include `--no-cov` in `pytestArgs` when debugging tests, for example by adding `"env": {"PYTEST_ADDOPTS": "--no-cov"}` to your debug configuration. (See [Debug Tests](#debug-tests) above about how to set up that launch configuration.) (For more information, see [Debuggers and PyCharm](https://pytest-cov.readthedocs.io/en/latest/debuggers.html) in the pytest-cov documentation.)

### IntelliSense settings

| IntelliSense setting<br/>(python.analysis.) | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| inlayHints.pytestParameters | false | Whether to display inlay hints for pytest fixture argument types. Accepted values are `true` or `false`. |
