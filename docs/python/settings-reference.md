# Python settings reference

The Python Extension for VS Code is highly configurable. This page describes the key settings you can work with.

Refer to [User and workspace settings](/docs/getstarted/settings.md) to find our more about working with settings in VS Code generally.

## General settings

| Setting | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| python.pythonPath | `"python"` | Path to the python interpreter. |
| python.venvPath | `""` | Path to folder with a list of Virtual Environments, such as `~/.pyenv`, `~/Envs`, `~/.virtualenvs`. |
| python.envFile | `"${workspaceFolder}/.env"` | Absolute path to a file containing environment variable definitions. |
| python.terminal.launchArgs | `[]` | Launch arguments given the Python interpreter when running a file. |
| python.terminal.executeInFileDir | `false` | Indicates whether to run a file in the file's directory instead of the current folder. |
| python.terminal.activateEnvironments | `true` | Indicates whether a selected virtual or conda environments is activated when using the **Python: Create Terminal** command or any other operation involving the terminal, such as the **Send Python File to Terminal** menu command. If `false`, skips activating virtual and conda environments before running the commands. |
| python.jediPath | `""` | Path to folder containing the Jedi library (folder should contain a `jedi` subfolder). |

## Workspace symbol (tags) settings

Workspace symbols are symbols in C source code generated by the ctags tool (described on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ctags) and on [ctags.sourceforge.net](http://ctags.sourceforge.net/ctags.html)). To quote Wikipedia, ctags "generates an index (or tag) file of names found in source and header files of various programming languages." Where Python is concerned, ctags makes it easier to jump to defined functions and other symbols in C/C++ extension modules.

| Setting<br/>(python.workspaceSymbols.) | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| tagFilePath | `"${workspaceFolder}/.vscode/tags"` | Fully qualified path to tag file (an exuberant ctag file), used to provide workspace symbols. |
| enabled | `true` | Specifies whether to enable the Workspace Symbol provider. |
| rebuildOnStart | `true` | Specifies whether to re-build the tags file on start. |
| rebuildOnFileSave | `true` | Specifies whether to re-build the tags file on when saving a Python file. |
| ctagsPath | `"ctags"` | Fully qualified path to the ctags executable; default value assumes it's in the current environment. |
| exclusionPatterns | `["**/site-packages/**"]` | Pattern used to exclude files and folders from ctags. |
