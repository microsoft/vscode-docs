# Run and Debug Python in the Web

We are happy to announce experimental support for running Python code on the Web. To try it out, install the latest pre-release version of the [Experimental - Python for the Web](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-python-web-wasm) extension from the Marketplace.

## Prerequisites

The following prerequisites are needed to use the extension:

* You need to have the [GitHub Repositories](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.remotehub) extension installed.
* You need to authenticate with GitHub.
* You need to use a browser that supports [cross-origin isolation](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/cross-origin-isolation/). The extension has been tested with the Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome browsers.
* You need to use the insider version of [VS Code for the Web](/docs/editor/vscode-web.md) (e.g. `https://insiders.vscode.dev/`)
* Your source code must either be hosted on a GitHub repository and accessed through the GitHub Repositories extension, or on your local file system.
* When starting [VS Code for the Web](/docs/editor/vscode-web.md), you need to add the following query parameter to the URL: `?vscode-coi=`.

## Run Hello World

The screenshot below shows the execution of a simple Python program in the browser. The program consists of two files `app.py` and `hello.py` stored on the local file system.

## Start a REPL

The extension comes with an integrated Python REPL. To activate it, run the command **Python WASM: Start REPL**.

## Debugging

There is support for debugging Python files on the Web. The features currently supported are:

* Set breakpoints
* Step into and out of functions
* Debug across modules
* Evaluate variables in the Debug Console
* Debug the program in the Integrated Terminal

The screenshot below shows an active debug session. The files are hosted directly on GitHub on this [sample repository](https://github.com/dbaeumer/python-sample).

## Create your own Python environment

The extension uses a pre-configured Python environment based on the [CPython WebAssembly builds](https://github.com/tiran/cpython-wasm-test/releases). The build used is `Python-3.11.0-wasm32-wasi-16.zip`.

You can create your own Python environment, including source wheel Python packages, following these steps:

* Create a new GitHub repository.
* Download a wasm-wasi-16 build from [cpython-wasm-test/releases](https://github.com/tiran/cpython-wasm-test/releases) and expand it into the root of the repository.
* To add source wheel packages, do the following:
  * Create a `site-packages` folder in the root.
  * Install the package using the following command `pip install my_package --target ./site-packages`. Note that you need to have a Python installation in your OS including pip.
* Commit the changes.
* Change the `python.wasm.runtime` setting to point to your GitHub repository. For example:

  ```json
  {
    "python.wasm.runtime": "https://github.com/dbaeumer/python-3.11.0"
  }
  ```

## Limitations

The Python for the Web support doesn't provide all the features available when running source code on your local machine. The major limitations in the Python interpreter are:

* No socket support.
* No thread support. As a consequence, there is no async support.
* No pip support.
* No support for native Python modules.

## Acknowledgment

The work would have not been possible without the support of the Python community, who are building and maintaining the necessary WASM files of CPython.

## Feedback

If you run into issues while using the Python for the Web extension, you can enter issues in the [vscode-python-web-wasm](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-python-web-wasm) repository.
