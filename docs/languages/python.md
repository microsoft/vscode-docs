# Python in Visual Studio Code

Working with Python in Visual Studio Code, using the [Microsoft Python extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python), is simple, fun, and productive. The extension makes VS Code an excellent Python editor, and works on any operating system with a variety of Python interpreters. It leverages all of VS Code's power to provide auto complete and IntelliSense, linting, debugging, and unit testing, along with the ability to easily switch between Python environments, including virtual and conda environments.

This article provides only an overview of the different capabilities of the Python extension for VS Code. For a walkthrough of editing, running, and debugging code, use the button below.

## Install Python and the Python extension

The [tutorial](/docs/python/python-tutorial.md) guides you through installing Python and using the extension. You must install a Python interpreter yourself separately from the extension. For a quick install, use [Python from python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [install the extension from the VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python).

Once you have a version of Python installed, activate it using the **Python: Select Interpreter** command. If VS Code doesn't automatically locate the interpreter you're looking for, refer to [Environments - Manually specify an interpreter](/docs/python/environments.md#manually-specify-an-interpreter).

You can configure the Python extension through settings. Learn more in the [Python Settings reference](/docs/python/settings-reference.md).

>**Windows Subsystem for Linux**: If you are on Windows, WSL is a great way to do Python development. You can run Linux distributions on Windows and Python is often already installed. When coupled with the [WSL](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl) extension, you get full VS Code editing and debugging support while running in the context of WSL. To learn more, go to [Developing in WSL](/docs/remote/wsl.md) or try the [Working in WSL](/docs/remote/wsl-tutorial.md) tutorial.

## Run Python code

To experience Python, create a file (using the [File Explorer](/docs/getstarted/userinterface.md#explorer)) named `hello.py` and paste in the following code:

```python
print("Hello World")
```

The Python extension then provides shortcuts to run Python code in the currently selected interpreter (**Python: Select Interpreter** in the Command Palette):

- In the text editor: right-click anywhere in the editor and select **Run Python File in Terminal**. If invoked on a selection, only that selection is run.
- In Explorer: right-click a Python file and select **Run Python File in Terminal**.

You can also use the **Terminal: Create New Terminal** command to create a terminal in which VS Code automatically activates the currently selected interpreter. See [Environments](#environments) below. The **Python: Start REPL** activates a terminal with the currently selected interpreter and then runs the Python REPL.

For a more specific walkthrough on running code, see the [tutorial](/docs/python/python-tutorial.md).

## Autocomplete and IntelliSense

The Python extension supports code completion and IntelliSense using the currently selected interpreter. [IntelliSense](/docs/editor/intellisense.md) is a general term for a number of features, including intelligent code completion (in-context method and variable suggestions) across all your files and for built-in and third-party modules.

IntelliSense quickly shows methods, class members, and documentation as you type, and you can trigger completions at any time with `kb(editor.action.triggerSuggest)`. You can also hover over identifiers for more information about them.

> **Tip**: Check out the [IntelliCode extension for VS Code (preview)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2006060). IntelliCode provides a set of AI-assisted capabilities for IntelliSense in Python, such as inferring the most relevant auto-completions based on the current code context.

## Linting

Linting analyzes your Python code for potential errors, making it easy to navigate to and correct different problems.

The Python extension can apply a number of different linters including Pylint, pycodestyle, Flake8, mypy, pydocstyle, prospector, and pylama. See [Linting](/docs/python/linting.md).

## Debugging

No more `print` statement debugging! Set breakpoints, inspect data, and use the debug console as you run your program step by step. Debug a number of different types of Python applications, including multi-threaded, web, and remote applications.

For Python-specific details, including setting up your `launch.json` configuration and remote debugging, see [Debugging](/docs/python/debugging.md). General VS Code debugging information is found in the [debugging document](/docs/editor/debugging.md). The [Django](/docs/python/tutorial-django.md) and [Flask](/docs/python/tutorial-flask.md) tutorials also demonstrate debugging in the context of those web apps, including debugging Django page templates.

## Environments

The Python extension automatically detects Python interpreters that are installed in standard locations. It also detects conda environments as well as virtual environments in the workspace folder. See [Configuring Python environments](/docs/python/environments.md).

The current environment is shown on the left side of the VS Code Status Bar:

![Selected Python interpreter in the Status Bar](images/python/selected-interpreter-status-bar.png)

The Status Bar also indicates if no interpreter is selected:

![Status bar showing no selected Python interpreter](images/python/no-interpreter-selected-statusbar.png)

The selected environment is used for IntelliSense, auto-completions, linting, formatting, and any other language-related feature other than debugging. It is also activated when you run Python in a terminal.

To change the current interpreter, which includes switching to conda or virtual environments, select the interpreter name on the Status Bar or use the **Python: Select Interpreter** command.

![Python: Select Interpreter command](images/python/select-interpreters-command.png)

VS Code prompts you with a list of detected environments as well as any you've added manually to your user settings (see [Configuring Python environments](/docs/python/environments.md)).

### Installing packages

Packages are installed using the **Terminal** panel and commands like `pip install <package_name>` (Windows) and `pip3 install <package_name>` (macOS/Linux). VS Code installs that package into your project along with its dependencies. Examples are given in the [Python tutorial](/docs/python/python-tutorial.md#install-and-use-packages) as well as the [Django](/docs/python/tutorial-django.md) and [Flask](/docs/python/tutorial-flask.md) tutorials.

## Jupyter notebooks

If you open a [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/) file (`.ipynb`) in VS Code, you can use the Jupyter Notebook Editor to directly view, modify, and run code cells.

![Jupyter notebook running in VS code in the Notebook Editor](images/python/native-jupyter.png)

You can also convert and open the notebook as a Python code file. The notebook's cells are delimited in the Python file with `#%%` comments, and the Python extension shows **Run Cell** or **Run All Cells** CodeLens. Selecting either CodeLens starts the Jupyter server and runs the cell(s) in the Python interactive window:

![Jupyter notebook running in VS Code and the Python interactive window](images/python/jupyter.png)

Opening a notebook as a Python file allows you to use all of VS Code's debugging capabilities. You can then save the notebook file and open it again as a notebook in the Notebook Editor, Jupyter, or even upload it to a service like [Azure Notebooks](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/notebooks).

Using either method, Notebook Editor or a Python file, you can also connect to a remote Jupyter server for running the code. For more information, see [Jupyter support](/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks.md).

## Testing

The Python extension supports [testing](/docs/python/testing.md) with unittest and pytest.

To run tests, you enable one of the frameworks in settings. Each framework also has specific settings, such as arguments that identify paths and patterns for test discovery.

Once discovered, VS Code provides a variety of commands (on the Status Bar, the Command Palette, and elsewhere) to run and debug tests, including the ability to run individual test files and individual methods.

## Configuration

The Python extension provides a wide variety of settings for its various features. These are described on their relevant topics, such as [Editing code](/docs/python/editing.md), [Linting](/docs/python/linting.md), [Debugging](/docs/python/debugging.md), and [Testing](/docs/python/testing.md). The complete list is found in the [Settings reference](/docs/python/settings-reference.md).
