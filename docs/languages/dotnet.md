# Using .NET in Visual Studio Code

[.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com) provides a fast and modular platform for creating many different types of applications that run on Windows, Linux, and macOS. Use Visual Studio Code with the C# and F# extensions to get a powerful editing experience with [C# IntelliSense](https://learn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/ide/visual-csharp-intellisense), F# IntelliSense (smart code completion), and debugging.

## Setting up VS Code for .NET development

### Installing extensions

If you are an existing VS Code user, you can add .NET support by installing the [C# Dev Kit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csdevkit) extension. C# Dev Kit brings a productive and reliable C# experience into VS Code, facilitating C# or multi-language development in VS Code. This extension pack consists of a set of VS Code extensions that work together to provide a rich C# editing experience, AI-powered development, solution management, and integrated testing experiences. As shown in the graphic below, C# Dev Kit consists of:

* The [C# extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csharp), which provides the base language services support and continues to be worked on and maintained independent of this effort.
* [C# Dev Kit extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csdevkit), which builds on the same base foundation as Visual Studio and provides solution management, templates, test discovery/debugging.
* The IntelliCode for C# Dev Kit extension(optional), which provides the AI-powered development experience to the editor.

If your projects require F# support, you can also download the [.NET Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.vscode-dotnet-pack), which includes these extensions:

* [C# Dev Kit for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csdevkit)
* [Ionide for F#](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Ionide.Ionide-fsharp)
* [Jupyter Notebooks](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter)
* [Polyglot Notebooks](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.dotnet-interactive-vscode)

You can also install extensions separately.

### .NET Coding Pack for students

To help you set up quickly, you can install the **.NET Coding Pack**, which includes VS Code, the .NET Software Development Kit, and essential .NET extensions. The Coding Pack can be used as a clean installation, or to update or repair an existing development environment.

<a class="install-extension-btn" onclick="pushCodingPackEvent('dotnet', 'mac')" href="https://aka.ms/dotnet-coding-pack-mac">Install the .NET Coding Pack - macOS</a><br>

> **Note**: The .NET Coding Pack is only available for Windows and macOS. For other operating systems, you will need to manually install the .NET SDK, VS Code, and .NET extensions.

## Installing the .NET Software Development Kit

If you download the extensions separately, ensure that you also have the .NET SDK on your local environment. The .NET SDK is a software development environment used for developing .NET applications.

## Create a C# "Hello World" app

1. Initialize a C# project:

   * Open a terminal/command prompt and navigate to the folder in which you'd like to create the app.
   * Enter the following command in the command shell:

   ```bat
     dotnet new console
   ```

2. When the project folder is first opened in VS Code:

   * A "Required assets to build and debug are missing. Add them?" notification appears at the bottom right of the window.
   * Select **Yes**.

3. Run the app by entering the following command in the command shell:

   ```bat
   dotnet run
   ```

## Create an F# "Hello World" app

1. Initialize an F# project:

   * Open a terminal/command prompt and navigate to the folder in which you'd like to create the app.
   * Enter the following command in the command shell:

   ```bat
   dotnet new console -lang "F#"
   ```

2. Once it completes, open the project in Visual Studio Code:

   ```bat
   code .
   ```

3. Run the app by entering the following command in the command shell:

   ```bat
    dotnet run
   ```
