# HTML Programming in VS Code
When editing HTML files in Visual Studio Code you get all of the basics and a few more things :)

## IntelliSense
As you type in HTML, we offer suggestions via HTML IntelliSense.  In the image below you can see a suggested HTML element closure `</div>` as well as a context specific list of suggested elements.

We also offer up suggestions for elements, tags, some values (as defined in HTML 5) and AngularJS tags.  You can trigger suggestions at any time by pressing `kb(editor.action.triggerSuggest)`.


## Format HTML
To improve the formatting of your HTML code press `kb(editor.action.format)` and the selected area will be reformatted.


## Emmet snippets
We support Emmet snippet expansion, simply press `kb(editor.emmet.action.expandAbbreviation)`.

>**Tip:** See the HTML section of the [Emmet cheat sheet](http://docs.emmet.io/cheat-sheet) for valid abbreviations.

We also support [User Defined Snippets](/docs/editor/customization#_user-defined-snippets).
