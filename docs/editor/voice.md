# Voice Support

The [VS Code Speech](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-speech) extension enables various features by using your voice. Once installed, the extension enables you to dictate into the editor, or to verbally interact with [GitHub Copilot Chat](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot-chat).

**Note:** voice support in VS Code does not require you to be online. Recordings are never sent to any online service but computed local on your machine.

## Editor dictation

You can dictate into the editor via these commands: **Voice: Start Dictation in Editor** (`kb(workbench.action.editorDictation.start)`) and **Voice: Stop Dictation in Editor** (`kb(workbench.action.editorDictation.stop)`). Once started, a little microphone icon appears where the cursor is, awaiting your voice input:

You can press and hold the keybinding for the voice start command (`kb(workbench.action.editorDictation.start)`) to enable **walky-talky mode**. Voice recognition is active until you release the keys, after which the request is submitted automatically.

**Note:** dictation even works in other places where a rich editor is used, such as the SCM commit input box and the comments input field when reviewing pull requests.

## Voice in GitHub Copilot Chat

You can use your voice to talk to [GitHub Copilot Chat](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot-chat) easily. The command **Voice: Start Voice Chat** (`kb(workbench.action.chat.startVoiceChat)`) brings up a voice chat, regardless of where the current focus is. If the focus is in the editor, inline chat is started, otherwise the Chat view is opened.

**Note:** when using voice for GitHub Copilot Chat, the chat prompt will automatically submit when you pause. You can configure the time to wait before submitting via the `accessibility.voice.speechTimeout` setting, or disable this functionality when you configure the setting to `0`.

## Walky talky mode

When using keyboard shortcuts to start voice (`kb(workbench.action.editorDictation.start)` or `kb(workbench.action.chat.startVoiceChat)`), either in the editor or chat, you can press and hold the keybinding to start the voice recognition. When you release the keybinding, voice recognition will stop. In addition, when used in chat, the prompt will be submitted.

## "Hey Code"

It is possible to enable a mode where VS Code will always listen for the phrase "Hey Code" to start a voice chat session. Configure the `accessibility.voice.keywordActivation` setting accordingly to enable this. When VS Code is listening for "Hey Code", a microphone icon appears in the status bar to indicate as such:

## Support for multiple languages

You can select from one of the 26 supported languages by using the `accessibility.voice.speechLanguage` setting. If you set the value to `auto` (default value), the VS Code Speech extension uses the [VS Code display language](/docs/getstarted/locales.md), if that language is available.

Each language for the speech extension comes as its own extension. When you start speech recognition for the first time, you will see an extension installation for each language you selected.
