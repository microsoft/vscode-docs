# Appendix

This is additional information for Visual Studio Code [tasks](/docs/editor/tasks.md).

## Schema for tasks.json

The following interfaces define the basic schema of the `tasks.json` file.

>**Note**: Some task options are contributed by VS Code extensions. You can use `tasks.json` IntelliSense to find a complete list, using the **Trigger Suggestions** command (`kb(editor.action.triggerSuggest)`).
