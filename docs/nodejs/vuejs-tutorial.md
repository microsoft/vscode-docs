# Using Vue in Visual Studio Code

[Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) is a popular JavaScript library for building web application user interfaces and Visual Studio Code has built-in support for the Vue.js building blocks of [HTML](/docs/languages/html.md), [CSS](/docs/languages/css.md), and [JavaScript](/docs/languages/javascript.md). For a richer Vue.js development environment, you can install the [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) and [Volar for TypeScript](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin) extensions that support Vue.js IntelliSense, code snippets, formatting, and more.

>**Note**: [Vue 2 support will end on December 31st, 2023](https://v2.vuejs.org/lts/) so the use of the [Vetur](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=octref.vetur) extension is [not recommended](https://github.com/vuejs/vetur/discussions/3378). You will need to [disable Vetur](https://vuejs.org/guide/typescript/overview.html#ide-support) to use Volar.

## Welcome to Vue

We'll be using the [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) tooling for this tutorial. If you are new to the Vue.js framework, you can find great documentation and tutorials on the [vuejs.org](https://vuejs.org) website.

To install and use Vite and Vue.js, you'll need the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) JavaScript runtime and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (the Node.js package manager) installed. npm is included with Node.js, which you can install from [Node.js downloads](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

>**Tip**: To test that you have Node.js and npm correctly installed on your machine, you can type `node --version` and `npm --version`.

To get started, make sure you are in the parent directory where you intend to create a project. Then open your terminal or command prompt and type:

```bash
npm create vue@latest
```

You will be prompted to install `create-vue`.

![Create vue](images/vuejs/create-vue.png)

This may take a few minutes to install and execute [create-vue](https://github.com/vuejs/create-vue), which helps you to scaffold your Vue project. Follow the prompts for optional features. You can choose "No" if you are unsure about an option.

![Vue app scaffolding](images/vuejs/vue-app-scaffolding.png)

Once the project is created, navigate into it and install dependencies. It may take a few minutes to install its dependencies.

```bash
cd <your-project-name>
npm install
```

Let's quickly run our Vue application by typing `npm run dev` to start the web server and open the application in a browser:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You should see "Welcome to your Vue.js App" on [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser. You can press `kbstyle(Ctrl+C)` to stop the `vue-cli-service` server.

To open your Vue application in VS Code, from a terminal (or command prompt), navigate to the `vue-project` folder and type `code .`:

```bash
cd vue-project
code .
```

VS Code will launch and display your Vue application in the File Explorer.

## Volar extension

Now expand the `src` folder and select the `App.vue` file. You'll notice that VS Code doesn't show any syntax highlighting and it treats the file as **Plain Text** as you can see in the lower right Status Bar. You'll also see a notification recommending the [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) extension for the `.vue` file type.

![Volar extension recommendation](images/vuejs/volar-extension-recommendation.png)

The Volar extension supplies Vue.js language features (syntax highlighting, IntelliSense, snippets, formatting) to VS Code.

![Volar extension](images/vuejs/volar-extension.png)

From the notification, press **Install** to download and install the Volar extension. You should see the Volar extension **Installing** in the Extensions view. Once the installation is complete (may take several minutes), the **Install** button changes to the **Manage** gear button.

You should now see that `.vue` is a recognized file type for the Vue.js language and you have language features such as syntax highlighting, bracket matching, and hover descriptions.

![Vue language features](images/vuejs/vue-language-features.png)

## IntelliSense

As you start typing in `App.vue`, you'll see smart suggestions or completions both for HTML and CSS but also for Vue.js specific items like declarations (`v-bind`, `v-for`) in the Vue `template` section:

![Vue.js suggestions](images/vuejs/suggestions.png)

and Vue properties such as `computed` in the `scripts` section:

![Vue.js JavaScript suggestions](images/vuejs/javascript-suggestions.png)

### Go to Definition, Peek definition

VS Code through the Volar extension Vue.js language service can also provide type definition information in the editor through **Go to Definition** (`kb(editor.action.revealDefinition)`) or **Peek Definition** (`kb(editor.action.peekDefinition)`). Put the cursor over the `App`, right-click and select **Peek Definition**. A [Peek window](/docs/editor/editingevolved.md#peek) opens showing the `App` definition from `App.js`.

![Vue.js peek definition](images/vuejs/peek-definition.png)

Press `kbstyle(Escape)` to close the Peek window.

## Hello World

Let's update the sample application to "Hello World!". In `App.vue` replace the HelloWorld component `msg` custom attribute text with "Hello World!".

```html
<template>
  <header>
    <img alt="Vue logo" class="logo" src="./assets/logo.svg" width="125" height="125" />

    <div class="wrapper">
      <HelloWorld msg="Hello World!" />
    </div>
  </header>

  <main>
    <TheWelcome />
  </main>
</template>
```

Once you save the `App.vue` file (`kb(workbench.action.files.save)`), restart the server with `npm run dev` and you'll see "Hello World!". Leave the server running while we go on to learn about Vue.js client side debugging.

>**Tip**: VS Code supports Auto Save, which by default saves your files after a delay. Check the **Auto Save** option in the **File** menu to turn on Auto Save or directly configure the `files.autoSave` user [setting](/docs/getstarted/settings.md).

## Linting

Linters analyze your source code and can warn you about potential problems before you run your application. The Vue ESLint plugin ([eslint-plugin-vue](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-vue)) checks for Vue.js specific syntax errors, which are shown in the editor as red squiggles and are also displayed in the **Problems** panel (**View** > **Problems** `kb(workbench.actions.view.problems)`).

Below you can see an error when the Vue linter detects more than one root element in a template:

![Vue linting](images/vuejs/vue-linting.png)

## Debugging

You can debug client side Vue.js code with the built-in JavaScript debugger. Follow this [conversation](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/discussions/4065#discussioncomment-1359932) to use Vite/Vue.js 3 project with VS Code using Microsoft Edge.

For Vue CLI, which is [now in maintenance mode](https://vuejs.org/guide/scaling-up/tooling#vue-cli), check out [Vue.js debugging in VS Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-recipes/tree/main/vuejs-cli) recipe on the VS Code debugging [recipes](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-recipes) site to learn more.

Another popular tool for debugging Vue.js is the [vue-devtools](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-devtools) plug-in, which can be used regardless of the environment.

## Other extensions

Volar is only one of many Vue.js extensions available for VS Code. Another recommended extension is [Volar for TypeScript](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).

![Vue recommended extensions](images/vuejs/vue-recommended-extensions.png)

You can search in the Extensions view (`kb(workbench.view.extensions)`) by typing 'vue'.

![Vue.js extensions](images/vuejs/vue-extensions.png)

Extension like [Vue VS Code Snippets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sdras.vue-vscode-snippets) can be handy for Vue snippets.

![Vue VS Code Snippets](images/vuejs/vue-vscode-snippets.png)

There are also Extension Packs, which bundle extensions that other people have found useful for Vue.js development.
