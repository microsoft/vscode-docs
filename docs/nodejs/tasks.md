# Integrate JavaScript Task Runners

VS Code includes a lightweigth task integration to make it easier to build and deploy your apps. Use your existing CLI tools like npm, Gulp, Grunt, and webpack, from within VS Code by modifying `tasks.json`. Use VS Code to run multiple tasks at once, bind tasks to a keyboard shortcut, and view the result of a task in the Output panel.

> **Tip:** For information regarding tasks in general, including a step by step process to configure a simple task, please refer to the [Task documentation](/docs/editor/tasks.md).
