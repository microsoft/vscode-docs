# JavaScript extensions for VS Code

Visual Studio Code supports many features for JavaScript and Node.js development. The features that ship with the downloaded product are the core features: debugging, IntelliSense, code navigation, etc.

In addition, to these core features, you can install a large number of quality extensions to add features to VS Code for JavaScript development.

> **Tip:** To see how to install and manage your extensions, please refer to the [extension documentation](/docs/editor/extension-marketplace.md).

## Finding extensions

You can find JavaScript extensions by typing `JavaScript` in the Extension view search bar. Alternatively, you can find JavaScript extensions using tags: "tag:javascript". Search for more extensions in VS Code or in the [Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/vscode).

## Recommended extensions

If you are just getting started, here are the extensions we recommend trying out.

### ESLint

Publisher - [Microsoft](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/publishers/Microsoft)

Easily integrate [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) into your project. If ESLint isn't your favorite linter, choose among a variety of other linter extensions, including [JSHint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.jshint), [JSCS](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.jscs), and [JS Standard](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=chenxsan.vscode-standardjs).

### SonarLint

Publisher - [SonarSource](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/publishers/SonarSource)

SonarLint helps you find and fix bugs and security issues as you code. The extension runs in the background and, just like a spell checker, highlights coding issues. SonarLint not only tells you what the issue is but also provides in-context guidance on why an issue is harmful and how to fix it, with related examples. The extension supports [200+ JS/TS rules](https://rules.sonarsource.com/javascript) and includes several [Quick Fixes](https://rules.sonarsource.com/javascript/quickfix) to automatically handle your coding issues.

Search for 'SonarLint' in the VS Code Marketplace and install. No configuration is required. You can start with a default profile that fits most users and customize it based on your specific needs.
