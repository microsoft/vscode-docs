# JavaScript Extensions for VS Code

Visual Studio Code supports many features for JavaScript and Node.js development. The features that ship with the downloaded product are the core features: debugging, IntelliSense, code navigation, etc.

In addition to these core features, you can install a large number of quality extensions to add features to VS Code for JavaScript development.

### Debugger for Chrome

Marketplace - [Debugger for Chrome](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msjsdiag.debugger-for-chrome)

Publisher - [Microsoft](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?term=publisher%3A%22Microsoft%22&target=VSCode&sortBy=Relevance)

When you develop for the front end, you might not see the value of an integrated debugger in your editor. You use the browser's debugger right? This is where the Debugger for Chrome extension comes in. This extension lets you debug your JavaScript code in the Google Chrome browser, or any other targets that support the [Chrome Debugging Protocol](https://chromedevtools.github.io/debugger-protocol-viewer/) while staying in VS Code. No more context switching to debug!

Prefer to debug using a different browser? You can find extensions for [Safari](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msjsdiag.debugger-for-ios-web), [Edge](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msjsdiag.debugger-for-edge), and [Firefox](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hbenl.vscode-firefox-debug) as well.
