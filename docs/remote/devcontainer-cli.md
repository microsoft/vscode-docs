# devcontainer command line interface

The [Remote-Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) has a `devcontainer` command line interface (CLI) which allows you to interact with a dev container from your terminal.

## Installing the devcontainer CLI

You can install the dev container CLI within VS Code or from the command line.

### Install using VS Code

1. Ensure you have the latest version of the [Remote-Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) installed (must be at least `v0.188.0`).

2. Launch Visual Studio Code and select  **Remote-Containers: Install devcontainer CLI** from the Command Palette (`kbstyle(F1)`).

* **Windows**: You will be prompted to automatically add the devcontainer CLI to your `PATH` or to copy the devcontainer CLI path to your clipboard for you to add to your `PATH`.
* **macOS/Linux**: If the extension detects a `bin` folder (or `.local/bin` folder) in your user home folder and in your `PATH`, then you will have the option of adding a symlink to the devcontainer CLI to this location. You will also have the option to copy the devcontainer CLI path to your clipboard for you to add to your `PATH`.

3. From an external terminal (one not inside Visual Studio Code), run `devcontainer --help` to test the installation and see the CLI's built-in help. Note that you may need to restart your shell for `PATH` changes to take effect.

    ```bash
     $ devcontainer --help
    devcontainer <command>
    :
      devcontainer open [path]             Open a dev container in VS Code
      devcontainer build [path] [options]  Build a dev container image

    Options:
      -h, --help  Show help  [boolean]
    ```

### Install from the command line

You may also install the CLI from the command line.

Global install:

```bash
$ npm install -g @vscode/dev-container-cli
$ devcontainer --help
```

Local install:

```bash
$ npm install @vscode/dev-container-cli
$ npx @vscode/dev-container-cli --help
```

## Opening a folder directly within a dev container

Visual Studio Code has many [command line options](/docs/editor/command-line.md), including `code .` that opens Visual Studio Code with the current folder. When you do this with a folder containing a dev container, Visual Studio Code will prompt you to reopen the folder within a dev container.

![Prompt to reopen folder within a dev container](images/devcontainer-cli/reopen-in-container.png)

With the devcontainer CLI, you can use the `devcontainer open` command to open the current folder straight into dev container mode, skipping the prompt.

You can optionally specify the path to the folder to open, for example `devcontainer open ~/source/my-folder` to open the `~/source/my-folder` folder within a dev container.

## Building a dev container image

The `devcontainer build` command allows you to build the dev container image for a folder. As with the `open` command, `build` accepts a path to the folder to build the image for and defaults to the current working folder in your shell. For example, `devcontainer build` will build the dev container image for the current folder and `devcontainer build ~/source/my-folder` will build the container image for the `~/source/my-folder` folder.

### devcontainer CLI build options

The following options can be used with the `build` command:

* `--no-cache` : By default, building a Docker container image reuses layers from previous image builds. The `--no-cache` option prevents the cache being used and forces the image to be rebuilt.
* `--image-name` : The Remote-Containers extension typically determines its own name for the images it builds. You can specify the name to use for the built image using the `--image-name` option.

## Visual Studio Code Insiders

 You can install the CLI for the Stable and Insiders builds of Visual Studio Code side-by-side. The Insiders CLI will be `devcontainer-insiders`, so use this in place of `devcontainer` in the steps above.
