# GitHub Copilot in VS Code

Copilot is your AI pair programmer tool in Visual Studio Code. Get code suggestions as you type in the editor, or use natural language chat to ask about your code or start an editing session for implementing new feature and fixing bugs.

VS Code integrates AI features seamlessly in your developer workflow. Choose the experience that is optimized for your specific scenario.

* **[AI Code completions](/docs/copilot/ai-powered-suggestions.md)**: start typing in the editor, and Copilot provides code suggestions based on your existing code that match your coding style.

* **[Natural language chat](/docs/copilot/chat/copilot-chat.md)**: use a conversational interface to ask about your codebase or make edits across your project. Switch between ask, edit, agent mode based on your needs.
