# Getting started with GitHub Copilot in VS Code

This tutorial walks you through using the [GitHub Copilot Chat](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot-chat) extension in Visual Studio Code. You use AI-powered chat conversations to help with refactoring code, improving your code understanding, and finding your way around configuring VS Code.

If you're new to using GitHub Copilot in VS Code, see the [GitHub Copilot Getting Started](/docs/copilot/getting-started.md) or the [GitHub Copilot Overview](/docs/copilot/overview.md).

## Prerequisites

If you want to use GitHub Copilot, you either need a subscription for GitHub Copilot in your personal account, or you need to be assigned a seat by your organization.

To get started, go through the steps to [Set up VS Code for GitHub Copilot](/docs/copilot/getting-started.md#set-up-vs-code-for-github-copilot).

## Install the GitHub Copilot Chat extension

The Chat features are available by installing the [GitHub Copilot Chat](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot-chat) extension.

## Get your first Copilot chat conversation

As you're iterating over your code, there might be moments where you need help from your AI pair programmer to accomplish a task. In the [Copilot Getting Started](/docs/copilot/getting-started.md), you used Copilot inline suggestions and optionally provided context by using code comments.

In some cases, it might be more efficient to just ask Copilot about a specific topic by using a chat message. For example, a common cause for errors is when a method receives invalid input. In this step, you start with a simple calculator in TypeScript, and use GitHub Copilot Chat to refactor the code to add error handling.

Let's use GitHub Copilot to help us add error handling to our code.

1. Open Visual Studio Code and create a new TypeScript file `Calculator.ts`.

1. In the TypeScript file, paste the following code that implements a simple `Calculator` class.

    ```typescript
    class Calc {
        add(a: number, b: number): number {
            return a + b;
        }
    
        subtract(a: number, b: number): number {
            return a - b;
        }
    
        factorial(a: number): number {
            if (a === 0 || a === 1) {
                return 1;
            }
            return a * this.factorial(a - 1);
        }
    }
    
    let calculator = new Calc();
    console.log(calculator.add(5, 3));
    ```

    Notice that the `factorial` method will actually fail when given a negative number as input.

1. In the editor, select the code block for the `factorial` method.

    By selecting text in the editor, you're providing extra context to GitHub Copilot about what to act upon.

1. Then press `kb(inlinechat.start)` on your keyboard to bring up Copilot inline chat.

    With inline chat, you can ask Copilot any questions while you're in the editor writing and iterating on your code.

1. Enter *Add error handling* in the input box, and then press `kb(Enter)`.

    Copilot sends the request, and then shows an inline diff with the proposed code changes.

1. Select **Accept** or **Discard** to apply or ignore the changes.

    If you're not happy with the suggested code changes, you can select the **Regenerate** button to get another suggestion.

## Generate code documentation

To make your code more readable and maintainable, you can add code documentation. This can be a tedious task, so let's use Copilot to help generate documentation comments for our code.

![Video that shows using Copilot Chat to add documentation comments to a method.](./images/getting-started-chat/copilot-chat-add-docs.gif)

1. In the editor, select the code block for the `add` method.

1. Then press `kb(inlinechat.start)` on your keyboard to bring up Copilot inline chat.

1. Enter the */doc* slash command in the input box and press `kb(Enter)`.

    Copilot chat has several slash commands, which are a shorthand notation for command chat instructions. The */doc* command is short for generating documentation comments.

    To view the list of slash commands, enter just */* in the chat input box.

1. Notice that Copilot suggests a documentation comment.

1. Either **Accept** or **Discard** the suggestion.

## Improve your code understanding

So far, you used Copilot to generate code suggestions. Next, you use Copilot to help you with code understanding. For example, you might be learning a new programming language, or you're jumping into a new code base.

![Video that shows using the Chat view to explain a code fragment and refactor it to not use recursion.](./images/getting-started-chat/copilot-chat-add-docs.gif)

Let's ask Copilot to help us with better understand the `factorial` method.

1. In the editor, select the code block for the `factorial` method.

1. Then press `kb(inlinechat.start)` on your keyboard to bring up Copilot inline chat.

1. Enter */explain* in the chat input box and press `kb(Enter)`.

1. Notice that the Chat view opens automatically, and a request is sent to GitHub Copilot.

    > **Note:** you can open the Chat view directly from the Activity Bar at any time, to start a conversation with GitHub Copilot.

1. Copilot returns a detailed description of what the method does and explains the implementation.

    The Chat view maintains the context of your questions, and lets you ask follow-on questions. For example, in the previous answer, it was stated that the `factorial` method uses recursion, so you might ask *What is recursion*.

1. Let's now ask if Copilot can make our code better by entering *Can you make this code more efficient* in the Chat view input box.

    Notice that Copilot understands that *this code* refers to source code that we referred to earlier, when asking for an explanation.

1. Let's now copy the code block that Copilot returned and use it to improve our code.

    You can also immediately insert the code block in the editor at the cursor location, or insert it in a new file.

## Find your way around VS Code

With GitHub Copilot Chat in VS Code, you can not only ask about your code, but you can also ask questions about VS Code itself. For example, you might be looking for a specific command or setting.

![Video that shows using the Chat view to find VS Code features such as the 'auto save' setting.](./images/getting-started-chat/copilot-chat-vscode.gif)

Follow these examples or experiment yourself to let Copilot help you explore VS Code features:

1. In the Chat view, enter the following text: *@vscode How do I disable auto-save?*

    Notice that Copilot returns a JSON fragment for setting the `files.autoSave` value. Also, the result also contains a button for directly opening the Settings editor.

1. In the Chat view, enter the following text: *@vscode How do I change the color of VS Code?*

    Notice that Copilot presents you with a button to open the Command Palette and prepopulates the command.

    You can also be less specific when asking Copilot for a VS Code feature. For example, try "@vscode What's that thing to not get interrupted while coding?"

## Congratulations

Congratulations, you successfully used the [GitHub Copilot Chat](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot-chat) extension to have AI-powered conversations about your improving or explaining your code, and about finding your way around VS Code.

Next, learn more about the features in GitHub Copilot in VS Code in the [GitHub Copilot Overview](/docs/copilot/overview.md).
