# GitHub Copilot in VS Code cheat sheet

GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code provides AI-powered features to help you write code faster and with less effort. This cheat sheet provides a quick overview of the features for GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code.

You can access GitHub Copilot in VS Code through the Chat view, directly in the editor, from the integrated terminal, and via AI-powered enhancements in the VS Code user interface.

> [!TIP]
> If you don't yet have a Copilot subscription, you can use Copilot for free by signing up for the [Copilot Free plan](https://github.com/github-copilot/signup) and get a monthly limit of completions and chat interactions.

The team is continuously working on improving Copilot in VS Code and adding new features. Some features are still experimental. Try them out and share your feedback in [our issues](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-copilot-release/issues).

## Chat with GitHub Copilot

Use natural language to chat with GitHub Copilot and get help with coding tasks. For example, ask Copilot to explain a block of code or a programming concept. Get more information about using [Copilot Chat](/docs/copilot/chat/copilot-chat.md).

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `kb(workbench.action.chat.open)` | Open the **Chat view**. |
| `kb(workbench.action.quickchat.toggle)` | Open **Quick Chat** and ask a quick question to Copilot. |
| `kb(inlinechat.start)` | Start **Inline Chat** to send a chat request to Copilot directly from the editor. Use natural language or use `/` commands to give instructions to Copilot. |
| `kb(workbench.action.chat.toggleAgentMode)` | Toggle between different [chat modes](/docs/copilot/chat/copilot-chat.md#chat-mode) in the Chat view. |
| `Add Context...` | Attach different types of context to your chat prompt. |

## Copilot in the editor

As you're coding in the editor, you can use Copilot to generate code completions as you're typing. Invoke Inline Chat to ask questions and get help from Copilot, while staying in the flow of coding. For example, ask Copilot to generate unit tests for a function or method. Get more information about [code completions](/docs/copilot/ai-powered-suggestions.md) and [Inline Chat](/docs/copilot/chat/inline-chat.md).

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Code completions | Start typing in the editor and Copilot provides code suggestions that match your coding style and take your existing code into account. |
| Code comments | Provide a code completion prompt to Copilot by writing instructions in a code comment.<br/>Example: `# write a calculator class with methods for add, subtract, and multiply. Use static methods.` |
| Next Edit Suggestions | Predict your next code edit with Copilot Next Edit Suggestions. Enable Copilot NES with the `setting(github.copilot.nextEditSuggestions.enabled)` setting. Learn how to get started with [Copilot NES](/docs/copilot/ai-powered-suggestions.md#next-edit-suggestions). |
| `kb(inlinechat.start)` | Start **Inline Chat** to send a chat request to Copilot directly from the editor. Use natural language or use `/` commands to give instructions to Copilot. |
| `kb(editor.action.rename)` | Get AI-powered suggestions when renaming symbols in your code. |

> **Tips**
>
> - Use meaningful method or function names to get better code completions quicker.
> - Select a code block to scope your Inline Chat prompt or attach relevant context by attaching files or symbols.
> - Use the editor context menu options to access common Copilot actions directly from the editor.

## Customize AI code generation
