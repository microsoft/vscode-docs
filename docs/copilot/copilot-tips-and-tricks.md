# Tips and tricks for Copilot in VS Code

This article provides tips and tricks to optimize your development experience for using GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code.

## Choose the right Copilot tool

Depending on your task, you can choose between different Copilot tools.

### Code completions

* Completing code snippets, variable names, and functions as you write them in the editor
* Generating repetitive code
* Generating code from inline comments in natural language

Get started with [code completions](/docs/copilot/ai-powered-suggestions.md).

### Chat

* Answering questions about your code or technology in general by using natural language
* Brainstorming on software design and architecture ideas and concepts
* Accomplishing domain-specific tasks with subject-matter chat participants
* Generating code blocks, which you can then apply to your codebase

Get started with [Copilot Chat](/docs/copilot/copilot-chat.md).

### Edits

* Generating and directly applying large sections of code across multiple files in your project
* Implementing high-level requirements by autonomously applying code changes and running commands to meet those requirements

Get started with [Copilot Edits](/docs/copilot/copilot-edits.md).

## Personalize Copilot with custom instructions

When Copilot generates code or answers questions, it tries to match your coding practices and preferences such as which libraries you use or how you name your variables. However, it might not always have enough context to do this effectively. For example, if you work with a specific framework version, you need to provide additional context in your prompts.

To enhance Copilot's responses, you can use _custom instructions_ to provide it with contextual details about your team's workflow, tools, or project specifics. Copilot then incorporates these custom instructions with every request.

To enable custom instructions for your workspace:

1. Enable the `setting(github.copilot.chat.codeGeneration.useInstructionFiles)`
1. Create a `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file in the root of your workspace
1. Add your instructions in Markdown format to the file. For example:

    ```markdown
    # Custom instructions for Copilot

    ## Project context
    This project is a web application built with React and Node.js.

    ## Indentation
    We use tabs, not spaces.

    ## Coding style
    Use camelCase for variable names and prefer arrow functions over traditional function expressions.

    ## Testing
    We use Jest for unit testing and Playwright for end-to-end testing.
    ```

## Prompt engineering

You can enhance the quality of Copilot's responses by using effective prompts. A well-crafted prompt can help Copilot understand your requirements better and generate more relevant code suggestions.

* Start general, then get specific.

    ```text
    Generate a Calculator class.
    Add methods for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and factorial.
    Don't use any external libraries and don't use recursion.
    ```

* Give examples of what you want.

    ```text
    Generate a function that takes a string and returns the number of vowels in it.
    Example:
    findVowels("hello") returns 2
    findVowels("sky") returns 0
    ```

* Break down complex tasks into simpler tasks.

    Instead of asking Copilot to generate a meal planner app, break it down into smaller tasks:
    * Generate a function that takes a list of ingredients and returns a list of recipes.
    * Generate a function that takes a list of recipes and returns a shopping list.
    * Generate a function that takes a list of recipes and returns a meal plan for the week.

* Provide the [right context](#provide-the-right-context), such as code selections, files, terminal output, and more.

    Example, use the `#codebase` variable to refer to the entire codebase:

    ```text
    Where is the database connection string used in #codebase?
    ```

* Iterate on your prompts.

    Provide follow-up prompts to refine or modify the response. For example:

    * "Write a function to calculate the factorial of a number."
    * "Don't use recursion and optimize by using caching."
    * "Use meaningful variable names."

* Keep chat history relevant.

    Copilot uses history of the conversation to provide context. Remove past questions and responses from the history if they're not relevant. Or, start a new session if you want to change the context.

Find practical [examples of prompts to use with Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/copilot-chat-cookbook) in the GitHub Copilot documentation.

## Provide the right context

Enrich your prompts with relevant context to get more accurate and relevant response from Copilot.

* Use the `#codebase` variable to let Copilot find the right files automatically.
* Reference files or symbols in your prompt by using `#file` or `#sym` chat variables.
* Drag and drop files, folders, or editor tabs onto the chat prompt.
* Add problems, test failures, or terminal output to your chat prompt for scenario-specific context.
* Add images or screenshots to your prompt to let Copilot analyze the image.

When you use [Agent mode](/docs/copilot/copilot-edits.md#use-agent-mode-preview), Copilot autonomously finds the relevant files and context for you.

## Reusable prompts

Reusable prompts enable you to save a prompt for a specific task with its context and instructions in a file. You can then attach and reuse that prompt in chat. If you store the prompt in your workspace, you can also share it with your team.

To create a reusable prompt:

1. Configure the `setting(chat.promptFiles)` setting.

1. Use the **Create Prompt** command from the Command Palette to create a `.prompt.md` file in your workspace.

1. Describe your prompt and relevant context in Markdown format.

    For example, use this prompt to generate a new React form component.

    ```markdown
    Your goal is to generate a new React form component.

    Ask for the form name and fields if not provided.

    Requirements for the form:
    * Use form design system components: [design-system/Form.md](../docs/design-system/Form.md)
    * Use `react-hook-form` for form state management:
    * Always define TypeScript types for your form data
    * Prefer *uncontrolled* components using register
    * Use `defaultValues` to prevent unnecessary rerenders
    * Use `yup` for validation:
    * Create reusable validation schemas in separate files
    * Use TypeScript types to ensure type safety
    * Customize UX-friendly validation rules
    ```

1. Add the prompt as context in chat.

Get started with [reusable prompts](/docs/copilot/copilot-customization.md#reusable-prompt-files-experimental).

## Choose your AI model

Different Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on different types of data and might have different capabilities and strengths. For example, some models might be better at generating code, while others might be better at answering questions or providing explanations.

Experiment with different models to find the one that works best for your specific use case. Use the model picker in the chat input field to switch between different models.

## Workspace indexing

Copilot uses an index to quickly and accurately search your codebase for relevant code snippets. This index can either be maintained by GitHub or stored locally on your machine.

For GitHub repositories, you can use a remote index of your workspace, based on [GitHub code search](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/using-github-copilot/asking-github-copilot-questions-in-github#asking-exploratory-questions-about-a-repository). This allows Copilot to search your entire codebase very quickly, even if the codebase is very large.
