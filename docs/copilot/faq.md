### My Copilot subscription is not detected in VS Code

- To use GitHub Copilot Chat in Visual Studio Code, you must be signed into Visual Studio Code with the same GitHub ID that has access to GitHub Copilot. If your Copilot subscription is associated with another GitHub account, you might have to sign out of your GitHub account and sign in with another account. Use the **Accounts** menu in the Activity bar for signing out of your current GitHub account.

- Verify that your Copilot subscription is still active in [GitHub Copilot settings](https://github.com/settings/copilot).

## General

### Network and firewall configuration for Copilot

- If you or your organization employs security measures like a firewall or proxy server, it may be beneficial to include certain domain URLs in an "allowlist" and open specific ports and protocols. Learn more about troubleshooting [firewall settings for GitHub Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/troubleshooting-github-copilot/troubleshooting-firewall-settings-for-github-copilot).

- If you're working on company equipment and connecting to a corporate network, you may be connecting to the Internet via a VPN or an HTTP proxy server. In some cases, these types of network setups may prevent GitHub Copilot from connecting to GitHub's server. Learn more about [troubleshooting network errors for GitHub Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/troubleshooting-github-copilot/troubleshooting-network-errors-for-github-copilot).

### How can I provide feedback on Copilot?

You can give feedback on Copilot inline suggestions and responses in the [GitHub Copilot Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

If you would like to provide feedback on the Copilot Chat features, you can create issues in the [vscode-copilot-release](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-copilot-release/issues) repository.

It can be helpful to include information from the [GitHub Copilot logs](#view-logs-for-github-copilot-in-vs-code) if you're reporting an issue.

### View logs for GitHub Copilot in VS Code

The log files for the GitHub Copilot extension are stored in the standard log location for Visual Studio Code extensions. The log files are useful for diagnosing connection issues.

Use the **Toggle Output** command (`kb(workbench.action.output.toggleOutput)`) and select **GitHub Copilot** or **GitHub Copilot Chat** in the dropdown.

### Are there pre-release builds of the Copilot extensions?

Yes, you can switch to the pre-release (nightly) version of a Copilot extension to try the latest features and fixes. From the Extensions view, right-click or select the gear icon to bring up the context menu, and then select **Switch to Pre-Release Version**:

### How do I enable/disable Copilot?
