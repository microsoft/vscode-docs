# Use Copilot Chat in VS Code

With Copilot Chat in Visual Studio Code, ask questions via chat to get code suggestions, increase your code understanding, and even configure your editor. Instead of searching for answers in documentation or online forums, ask Copilot directly in VS Code and immediately apply the suggestions to your codebase.

Instead of using chat to get suggestions, Copilot can also directly make edits across multiple files in your project. In this case, you might consider using [Copilot Edits](/docs/copilot/copilot-edits.md). You can easily [move an existing chat conversation to Copilot Edits](/docs/copilot/copilot-edits.md#send-a-chat-request-to-copilot-edits).

> [!TIP]
> If you don't yet have a Copilot subscription, you can use Copilot for free by signing up for the [Copilot Free plan](https://github.com/github-copilot/signup) and get a monthly limit of completions and chat interactions.

## Access Copilot Chat in VS Code

You can submit prompts to Copilot in VS Code in several ways, depending on your workflow.

* [**Chat view**](#chat-view): have an AI assistant on the side to help with your questions and to provide code suggestions (`kb(workbench.action.chat.open)`).
* [**Inline Chat**](#inline-chat): start an inline chat conversation directly from the editor or integrated terminal to get suggestions in-place (`kb(workbench.action.terminal.chat.start)`).
* [**Quick Chat**](#quick-chat): ask a quick question and get back into what you're doing (`kb(workbench.action.quickchat.toggle)`).

To access the chat experiences, use the corresponding keyboard shortcuts or use the Copilot menu in the VS Code title bar.

![Screenshot of the Copilot Chat menu in the VS Code Command Center](images/copilot-chat/copilot-chat-menu-command-center.png)

## Submit your first prompt

You can ask Copilot Chat to give code suggestions, increase your code understanding, set up debugging for your project, or help with configuring VS Code.

1. Open the Chat view with the (`kb(workbench.action.chat.open)`) keyboard shortcut or select **Open Chat** in the Copilot menu in the title bar.

    If you want to use chat to make edits directly in the active editor, use [Inline Chat](#inline-chat) instead (`kb(workbench.action.terminal.chat.start)`).

1. Enter your prompt in the chat input field or choose one of the prompt suggestions.

    Some example prompts:

    * Ask questions about coding and technology concepts (_"What is a linked list?"_, _"top 10 popular web frameworks"_)
    * Brainstorm ideas on how to best solve a coding problem (_"How to add auth to my project?"_)
    * Explain a block of code (_"@workspace /explain"_, _"What does this code do?"_)
    * Propose code fixes (_"@workspace /fix"_, _"This method gives a FileNotFoundException"_)
    * Generate unit test cases or code documentation (_"@workspace /tests"_, _"@workspace /doc"_)
    * Ask about VS Code settings (_@vscode how do I disable the minimap?_)

    For more prompt examples, see the [Copilot Chat Cookbook](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/example-prompts-for-github-copilot-chat) in the GitHub documentation.

1. Review the response from Copilot.

    The response may contain text, code blocks, buttons, links to code symbols, file trees, or other rich content. Get more information about how to [apply code suggestions](#apply-a-code-block-from-chat) to your codebase.

    To see which resources Copilot used for the response, select the **Used n resources** dropdown in the chat response. You can help Copilot give more relevant answers by [attaching the context to your chat prompt](#add-context-to-your-chat-prompt).

1. Optionally, ask follow-up questions to refine the response.

    As you keep the conversation going, Copilot maintains the [history of your chat messages and responses](#chat-history).

    To start over with a new chat session, use the **New Chat** (`kbstyle(+)`) button (`kb(workbench.action.chat.newChat)`) in the Chat view.

> [!TIP]
> Type `/help` in the chat input field to get help about GitHub Copilot and how to interact with Copilot Chat.

## Change the AI model

Different Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on different types of data and might have different capabilities and strengths. With Copilot, you can choose between different models to get the best results for your needs.

Use the model picker in the chat input field to change the model that Copilot uses for generating a response.

The list of available models might vary based on your Copilot subscription and might change over time. See the GitHub Copilot documentation for more information about the [available language models](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/ai-models/changing-the-ai-model-for-copilot-chat?tool=vscode).

## Add context to your chat prompt

Copilot tries to determine the intent and scope of your question based on your natural language chat prompt. In the chat response, select the **Used n resources** dropdown to see which resources Copilot used to generate the response.

To help Copilot give you the best and most relevant answers, add context to your chat prompt. For example, attach specific files, specific code symbols, the current editor selection, and more. Get more details about [adding context to your chat prompt](/docs/copilot/copilot-chat-context.md).

> [!TIP]
> Let Copilot find the right files automatically by adding `#codebase` in your prompt. Make sure to enable the `setting(github.copilot.chat.codesearch.enabled)` _(preview)_ setting to get the best results.

## Chat participants

_Chat participants_ are like domain experts who have a specialty that they can help you with. You can invoke a chat participant by typing '@' in the chat input field, followed by the participant name. There are several built-in chat participants, and extensions can also contribute chat participants.

To list all installed chat participants, type `@` in the chat input field.

| Built-in participant | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| `@workspace`     | Knows about the code in your workspace. Use it to navigate your code base, find relevant classes, files, and more.<br/><br/>**Example prompts:**<br/><ul><li>`@workspace how are notifications scheduled?`</li><li>`@workspace add form validation, similar to the newsletter page`</li></ul> |
| `@vscode`        | Knows about features, settings, and APIs of VS Code.<br/><br/>**Example prompt:**<br/><ul><li>`@vscode the name of that thing when vscode fake opens a file? And how to disable it?`</li></ul> |
| `@terminal`      | Knows about the integrated terminal shell and its contents.<br/><br/>**Example prompts:**<br/><ul><li>`@terminal how to undo the last commit`</li><li>`@terminal help with #terminalLastCommand`</li></ul> |
| `@github`        | Knows about and has skills for GitHub repositories issues, PRs, and more. Can also perform web searches using the Bing API. Get more information about [using GitHub skills](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/asking-github-copilot-questions-in-your-ide#using-github-skills-for-copilot).<br/><br/>**Example prompts:**<br/><ul><li>`@github What are all of the open PRs assigned to me?`</li><li>`@github #web what is the latest VS Code version`</li></ul> |

### Extension-contributed chat participants

You can install additional chat participants from either the [Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?term=tag%3Achat-participant&target=VSCode&category=All%20categories&sortBy=Relevance) or from the [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace).

Chat participants contributed via a VS Code extension are _client-side_ extensions that have full access to the VS Code extension API surface.

Chat participants contributed via a GitHub App do not run on your local machine and must explicitly request access to your local editor context. After you install a GitHub App that contributes a chat participant, the first time you `@-mention` the participant in VS Code, you are asked to authorize its access to your local editor context.

> [!NOTE]
> To protect your privacy, your preference for sharing editor context with chat participants from GitHub App is saved on a per-workspace basis, unless you select 'Allow for All Workspaces'.

These are some examples of VS Code extensions that contribute a chat participant. Go to the [Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?term=tag%3Achat-participant&target=VSCode&category=All%20categories&sortBy=Relevance) or use the integrated Extensions view (`kb(workbench.view.extensions)`) and search by tag `chat-participant` (`tag:chat-participant`).

<div class="marketplace-extensions-chat"></div>

## Slash commands

_Slash commands_ provide a shortcut to specific instructions to avoid that you have to write complex prompts. To use a slash command in your prompt, type the `/` character, followed by a command. Chat participants can contribute their own slash commands.

For example, `@workspace /new Express app with pug and typescript` is a shortcut for generating a new workspace and scaffold a new Express app in TypeScript that uses the Pug view engine.

Some common built-in slash commands are:

* `/clear`: start a new chat session
* `/help`: get help about using GitHub Copilot
* `@workspace /explain` (or `/explain`): explain how the selected code works
* `@workspace /fix` (or `/fix`): propose a fix for the problems in the selected code
* `@workspace /new` (or `/new`): scaffold code for a new workspace or new file

To list all available slash commands, type `/` in the chat input field.

## Chat variables

Use chat variables to include specific context in your prompt. To use a chat variable, type `#` in the chat prompt box, followed by a chat variable. For example, `#codebase` to let Copilot find the relevant files to add as context, or `#selection` to add the current editor selection to your chat prompt.

Get more information about [adding context to your chat prompt](/docs/copilot/copilot-chat-context.md).

## Inline Chat

To make edits directly in the editor, use Inline Chat to submit a prompt. Copilot provides code suggestions in-place with your code in the editor. If you have a block of code selected in the editor, Copilot scopes your question to that selection.

![Copilot Inline Chat asking to not use recursion for a factorial function.](images/copilot-chat/inline-chat-no-recursion.png)

To bring up Editor Inline Chat:

* In any file, use the `kb(inlinechat.start)` keyboard shortcut.
* Alternatively, open a file and then select **Editor Inline Chat** from the Copilot menu in the title bar.

After receiving a code suggestion, you can accept (`kb(inlineChat.acceptChanges)`) or discard (`kb(inlineChat.close)`) the changes. If you're not happy with the suggestion, enter a new prompt and Copilot provides a new suggestion.

You're not limited to asking for code changes. Use Inline Chat to ask more exploratory questions that emerge as you work with your codebase. For example, use prompts such as `Explain this piece of code`, or `How do I add functionality to do X?`.
> [!TIP]
> Attach context to your Inline Chat prompt to include relevant files, code symbols, or other context. Learn more about [adding context to your chat prompt](/docs/copilot/copilot-chat-context.md).

## Chat view

The Chat view is a dedicated view that is useful to keep open while you work on your code, and where you can have multi-turn conversations with Copilot.

![Copilot Chat view in the Secondary Side Bar and Explorer view in the Primary Side Bar.](images/copilot-chat/copilot-chat-view.png)

To open the Chat view:

* Use the `kb(workbench.action.chat.open)` keyboard shortcut.
* Alternatively, select **Open Chat** in the Copilot menu in the title bar.

By default, the Chat view is located in the Secondary Side Bar. The [Secondary Side Bar](/docs/editor/custom-layout.md#secondary-side-bar) is always positioned opposite the Primary Side Bar, so you can have the Chat view open at the same time as the Explorer, Source Control, or other views in the Primary Side Bar.

> [!TIP]
> At any time, you can drag the Chat view to another location, or even open it as an editor. Learn more about [custom layouts in VS Code](/docs/editor/custom-layout.md).

### Apply a code block from chat

Chat responses could contain one or more code blocks. Depending on the language extension, the code block in the chat response might support IntelliSense, which enables you get information about methods and symbols by hovering over them, or to go to their definition.

To apply a code block to your codebase, hover over the code block and select the **Apply in Editor** button. Copilot tries to apply the proposed changes to your existing code.

![Screenshot of a Copilot Chat code block response, highlighting the actions to apply changes.](images/copilot-chat/copilot-chat-view-code-block-actions.png)

Other actions that are available for code blocks are:

* Insert the code block at the current cursor position
* Copy the code block to the clipboard
* Insert the code block into the integrated terminal
* Insert the code block into a new file

If Copilot Chat detects that a code block contains a shell command, you can run it directly in the integrated terminal with **Insert into Terminal** (`kb(workbench.action.chat.runInTerminal)`). This option creates or opens the active terminal and inserts the command text, ready for you to run.

![Copilot Chat code block to list files with Insert into Terminal option visible](images/copilot-chat/run-in-terminal.png)

> [!TIP]
> Navigate between code blocks with **Chat: Next Code Block** (`kb(workbench.action.chat.nextCodeBlock)`) and **Chat Previous Code Block** (`kb(workbench.action.chat.previousCodeBlock)`).

You can control the font for code blocks in chat with the following settings:

* `setting(chat.editor.fontFamily)`
* `setting(chat.editor.fontSize)`
* `setting(chat.editor.fontWeight)`
* `setting(chat.editor.lineHeight)`

### Chat history

At any time, you can start a new chat session by using the **New Chat** button (`kb(workbench.action.chat.newChat)`) in the Chat view. This can be useful to ask Copilot about a different topic and avoid the previous context and history.

Copilot Chat maintains the history of your previous chat sessions, which you can access by using the **Show Chats...** button in the Chat view or by using the **Chat: Show Chats...** command in the Command Palette.

A Quick Pick shows the list of previous chats, order by most recent. You can select a chat to open it in the Chat view.

![Screenshot of the Chat view with the Show Chats... button highlighted](images/copilot-chat/copilot-chat-view-show-chats.png)

Within a chat session, you can remove a specific prompt and the corresponding response from the conversation history of that session. Hover over the prompt and select the **x** control. It might be useful to delete one or more prompts to get more relevant responses.

![Chat view with multiple prompts, highlighting the 'x' control to delete a chat prompt and response.](images/copilot-chat/copilot-chat-delete-prompt.png)

You can export all prompts and responses for a chat session in a JSON file with the **Chat: Export Chat...** command in the Command Palette.

## Quick Chat

If you want to ask Copilot a quick question and don't want to start a full Chat view session or open Inline Chat in your editor, you can use the Quick Chat dropdown.

![Quick Chat dropdown](images/copilot-chat/quick-chat-dropdown.png)

Press `kb(workbench.action.quickchat.toggle)` on your keyboard to bring up Quick Chat. Alternatively, select **Quick Chat** in the Copilot menu in the title bar.

If you want to keep the conversation going, promote a Quick Chat conversation to a full Chat view session with the **Open in Chat View** button in the upper right of the dropdown.

![Quick Chat Open in Chat View button](images/copilot-chat/open-in-chat-view.png)

## Terminal Inline Chat

Similar to [Inline Chat in the editor](#inline-chat), you can bring up Copilot Inline Chat in the terminal to help you answer questions related to the terminal and shell commands.

The terminal Inline Chat uses the `@terminal` [chat participant](#chat-participants), which has context about the integrated terminal's shell and its contents. For example, you can ask questions such as "how to install npm packages", or "list the top 5 largest files in the src directory".

To start Inline Chat in the terminal, press the `kb(inlinechat.start)` keyboard shortcut while you're in the terminal.

![Screenshot showing that you can ask complex questions like "list the top 5 largest files in the src dir"](images/copilot-chat/terminal-chat-2.png)

Once a command is suggested, use **Run** (`kb(workbench.action.terminal.chat.runCommand)`) to run the command in the terminal, or **Insert** (`kb(workbench.action.terminal.chat.insertCommand)`) to insert the command into the terminal.

## Smart actions

For several common scenarios, you can use _smart actions_ to get help from Copilot without having to write a prompt. Examples of these smart actions are for tasks, such as generating commit messages, generating documentation, fixing code, explaining code, or reviewing code changes.

These smart actions are available throughout the VS Code UI. For example, you can access Copilot smart actions from the editor context menu or through Quick Fix actions.

In the editor, you can access smart actions by selecting a block of code, right-clicking, and then choosing **Copilot**.

![Editor context menu with the Copilot menu group expanded](images/copilot-chat/copilot-smart-action-menu.png)

The most powerful smart action is the **Fix** action that helps you correct coding issues. Select the _sparkle_ icon in the editor, and then choose **Fix using Copilot**. There is a corresponding `/fix` slash command.

![Quick fix a type mismatch error by using the Copilot smart action](images/copilot-chat/smart-action-fix-with-copilot.png)

Similarly, there's a **Copilot** > **Generate Docs** smart action (`/doc` slash command) to generate documentation for your code.

## Use voice interactions

With the voice control capabilities in VS Code, provided by the [VS Code Speech](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-speech) extension, you can initiate a chat conversation by using your voice:

* Use your voice to dictate your chat prompt
* Use the "Hey Code" voice command to start a voice session with Copilot Chat
* Accelerate voice input for chat by using the "hold to speak" mode

Learn more about how to [use voice interactions in VS Code](/docs/editor/voice.md).

## Privacy and transparency

To enable more workspace search features for private repositories, we require additional permissions. If we detect that we don't have these permissions already, we will ask for them at startup. Once granted, we'll securely store the session for the future.

![Modal window asking for additional authentication for a private repository.](images/copilot-chat/authentication.png)

Learn more about security, privacy, and transparency in the [GitHub Copilot Trust Center](https://resources.github.com/copilot-trust-center/).
