# Custom instructions for GitHub Copilot in VS Code

You can enhance Copilot's chat responses by providing it with contextual details about your team's workflow, tools, or project specifics. Instead of manually including this context in every chat query, you can create a _custom instructions_ file that automatically incorporates this information with every chat request.

Copilot applies these instructions to chat prompts in the Chat view, Quick Chat, or Inline Chat. These instructions are not displayed in the chat, but are passed to Copilot by VS Code.

You can specify custom instructions for specific purposes:

* **Code-generation instructions** - provide context specific for generating code. For example, you can specify that private variables should always be prefixed with an underscore, or that singletons should be implemented a certain way. You can specify code-generation instructions in settings, or in a Markdown file in your workspace.

* **Test-generation instructions** - provide context specific for generating tests. For example, you can specify that all generated tests should use a specific testing framework. You can specify test-generation instructions in settings, or in a Markdown file in your workspace.

* **Code review instructions** - provide context specific for reviewing the current editor selection. For example, you can specify that the reviewer should look for a specific type of error in the code. You can specify review-selection instructions in settings, or in a Markdown file in your workspace.

* **Commit message generation instructions** - provide context specific for generating commit messages. You can specify commit-message-generation instructions in settings, or in a Markdown file in your workspace.

* **Pull request title and description generation instructions** - provide context specific for generating pull request titles and descriptions. You can specify pull request title and description generation instructions in settings, or in a Markdown file in your workspace.

Custom instructions consist of natural language instructions and should be short, self-contained statements that add context or relevant information to supplement chat questions.

## Define code-generation custom instructions

Copilot can help you generate code, for example as part of a refactoring, generating unit tests, or implementing a feature. You might have specific libraries you want to use in your project, or a particular coding style you want to follow for the code that Copilot generates.

> [!NOTE]
> Copilot does not apply code-generation instructions for [code completions](/docs/copilot/ai-powered-suggestions.md).

### Use settings

You can configure custom code-generation instructions by using the `setting(github.copilot.chat.codeGeneration.instructions)` setting. You can define custom instructions at the User or Workspace level, and you can also specify language-specific instructions. Get more information about [language-specific settings](/docs/editor/settings.md#language-specific-editor-settings).

The following code snippet shows how to define a set of instructions in the `settings.json` file. To define instruction directly in settings, configure the `text` property. To reference an external file, configure the `file` property.

```json
  "github.copilot.chat.codeGeneration.instructions": [
    {
      "text": "Always add a comment: 'Generated by Copilot'."
    },
    {
      "text": "In TypeScript always use underscore for private field names."
    },
    {
      "file": "code-style.md" // import instructions from file `code-style.md`
    }
  ],
```

An example of the contents of the `code-style.md` file:

```markdown
Always use React functional components.

Always add comments.
```

### Use a `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file

You can also store custom instructions in your workspace or repository in a `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file and have VS Code automatically picks up this file.

If you define custom instructions in both the `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file and in settings, Copilot tries to combine instructions from both sources.

> [!NOTE]
> GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio also detects the `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file. If you have a workspace that you use in both VS Code and Visual Studio, you can use the same file to define custom instructions for both editors.

1. Set the `setting(github.copilot.chat.codeGeneration.useInstructionFiles)` setting to `true` to instruct Copilot in VS Code to use the custom instructions file.

1. Create a `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file at the root of your workspace. If needed, create a `.github` directory first.

    > [!TIP]
    > In the Explorer view in VS Code, you can create the folder and directly in one operation by typing the full path as the file name.

1. Add natural language instructions to the file. You can use the Markdown format.

    Whitespace between instructions is ignored, so the instructions can be written as a single paragraph, each on a new line, or separated by blank lines for legibility.

## Define test-generation custom instructions

You can use Copilot to generate tests for your code, for example by using the `@workspace /tests` prompt in the Chat view. You can define custom instructions to help Copilot generate tests that are specific to your project and development workflow.

To configure custom test-generation instructions, use the `setting(github.copilot.chat.testGeneration.instructions)` setting. You can define custom instructions at the User or Workspace level.

The following code snippet shows how to define a set of instructions in the `settings.json` file. To define instruction directly in settings, configure the `text` property. To reference an external file, configure the `file` property.

```json
  "github.copilot.chat.testGeneration.instructions": [
    {
      "text": "Always use vitest for testing React components."
    },
    {
      "text": "Use Jest for testing JavaScript code."
    },
    {
      "file": "code-style.md" // import instructions from file `code-style.md`
    }
  ],
```

An example of the contents of the `code-style.md` file:

```markdown
Always add code comments.

Always use React functional components.
```

## Define code review custom instructions

You can use Copilot to review a selection of code in the editor. You can define custom instructions to help Copilot take into account specific code review criteria that are relevant to your project and development workflow.

To configure custom code review instructions, use the `setting(github.copilot.chat.reviewSelection.instructions)` setting. You can define custom instructions at the User or Workspace level.

## Define commit message generation custom instructions

In the Source Control view, you can use Copilot to generate a commit message for the pending code changes. You can define custom instructions to help Copilot generate a commit message that takes into account specific formatting and structure that are specific to your project and development workflow.

To configure custom commit message generation instructions, use the `setting(github.copilot.chat.commitMessageGeneration.instructions)` setting. You can define custom instructions at the User or Workspace level.

## Define pull request title and description generation custom instructions

When you have the [GitHub Pull Requests](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github) extension installed, you can use Copilot to generate a title and description for a pull request. You can define custom instructions to help Copilot generate a title and description that take into account specific formatting and structure that are specific to your project and development workflow.

To configure custom pull request title and description generation instructions, use the `setting(github.copilot.chat.pullRequestDescriptionGeneration.instructions)` setting. You can define custom instructions at the User or Workspace level.

## Tips for defining custom instructions

* Keep your instructions short and self-contained. Each instruction should be a single, simple statement. If you need to provide multiple pieces of information, use multiple instructions.

* Don't refer to external resources in the instructions, such as specific coding standards.

* Make it easy to share custom instructions with your team or across projects by storing your instructions in an external file. You can also version control the file to track changes over time.

## Reusable prompt files (experimental)

Prompt files (_prompts_) let you build and share reusable prompt instructions with additional context. A prompt file is a Markdown file that mimics the existing format of writing prompts in Copilot Chat (for example, `Rewrite #file:x.ts`). This allows blending natural language instructions, additional context, and even linking to other prompt files as dependencies.

While custom instructions help to add codebase-wide context to each AI workflow, prompt files let you add instructions to a specific chat interaction.

Common use cases include:

- **Code generation**: create reusable prompts for components, tests, or migrations (for example, React forms, or API mocks).
- **Domain expertise**: share specialized knowledge through prompts, such as security practices, or compliance checks.
- **Team collaboration**: document patterns and guidelines with references to specs and documentation.
- **Onboarding**: create step-by-step guides for complex processes or project-specific patterns.

### Prompt file examples

- `react-form.prompt.md` - documents a reusable task for generating a form:

    ```markdown
    Your goal is to generate a new React form component.

    Ask for the form name and fields if not provided.

    Requirements for the form:
    - Use form design system components: [design-system/Form.md](../docs/design-system/Form.md)
    - Use `react-hook-form` for form state management:
    - Always define TypeScript types for your form data
    - Prefer *uncontrolled* components using register
    - Use `defaultValues` to prevent unnecessary rerenders
    - Use `yup` for validation:
    - Create reusable validation schemas in separate files
    - Use TypeScript types to ensure type safety
    - Customize UX-friendly validation rules
    ```

- `security-api.prompt.md` - documents reusable security practices for REST APIs, which can be used to do security reviews of REST APIs:

    ```markdown
    Secure REST API review:
    - Ensure all endpoints are protected by authentication and authorization
    - Validate all user inputs and sanitize data
    - Implement rate limiting and throttling
    - Implement logging and monitoring for security events
    …
    ```

### Usage

To enable prompt files, configure the `setting(chat.promptFiles)` VS Code setting. By default, prompt files are located in the `.github/prompts` directory of your workspace. You can also [specify additional folders](#prompt-files-experimental-settings) where prompt files are located.

#### Create a prompt file

1. Create a `.prompt.md` file in the `.github/prompts` directory of your workspace.

1. Write prompt instructions by using Markdown formatting.

    Within a prompt file, reference additional workspace files as Markdown links (`[index](../index.ts)`), or as `#file:../index.ts` references within the prompt file.

    You can also reference other `.prompt.md` files to create a hierarchy of prompts, with reusable prompts that can be shared across multiple prompt files.

#### Attach a prompt file to a chat request

1. Select the **Attach Context** <i class="codicon codicon-attach"></i> icon (`kb(workbench.action.chat.attachContext)`), and then select **Prompt...**.

1. Choose a prompt file from the Quick Pick to attach it to your chat request.

    You can use prompt files in both Copilot Chat and Copilot Edits.

1. Optionally, attach additional context files required for the task.

    For reusable tasks, send the prompt without any additional instructions.

    To further refine a reusable prompt, include additional instructions to provide more context for the task at hand.

> [!TIP]
> Reference additional context files like API specs or documentation by using Markdown links to provide Copilot with more complete information.
