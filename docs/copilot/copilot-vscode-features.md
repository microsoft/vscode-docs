# GitHub Copilot in VS Code cheat sheet

GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code provides AI-powered features to help you write code faster and with less effort. This cheat sheet provides a quick overview of the features for GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code.

You can access GitHub Copilot in VS Code through the Chat view, directly in the editor, from the integrated terminal, and via AI-powered enhancements in the VS Code user interface.

The team is continuously working on improving Copilot in VS Code and adding new features. Items in the cheat sheet marked with <i class="codicon codicon-beaker"></i> are experimental features. Try them out and share your feedback in [our issues](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-copilot-release/issues).

## Chat with GitHub Copilot

Use natural language to chat with GitHub Copilot and get help with coding tasks. For example, ask Copilot to explain a block of code or a programming concept. Get more information about using [Copilot Chat](/docs/copilot/copilot-chat.md).

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `kb(workbench.action.chat.open)` | Open the **Chat view** and start a chat conversation with Copilot by using natural language. |
| `kb(workbench.action.quickchat.toggle)` | Open **Quick Chat** and ask a quick question to Copilot. |
| <i class="codicon codicon-mention"></i> | Type `@` in chat or select <i class="codicon codicon-mention"></i> to view the list of *chat participants*, which are domain experts that can help you in a specific area. Extensions can also contribute additional participants.<br/>Example: `@workspace how is auth implemented?`  |
| Participant detection <i class="codicon codicon-beaker"></i> | Copilot Chat can also automatically route your question to the appropriate participant. [Get more info](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_93#_automatic-chat-participant-detection-in-chat-view-experimental). |
| `/` | Invoke a *slash command* to prompt for commonly used actions, such as explaining a block of code, generating tests or documentation. |
| `/explain` | Ask Copilot to explain a block of code or a programming concept. |
| <i class="codicon codicon-history"></i> | Select this icon in the Chat view to access your history of chat sessions. |
| <i class="codicon codicon-mic"></i> | Enter a chat prompt by using speech (voice chat). The chat response is read out aloud. |

> **Tips**
>
> - Use `/` commands and `@` participants to get more precise and relevant answers.
> - Be specific, keep it simple, and ask follow-up questions to get the best results.
> - Provide context by attaching files, symbols, or selections to your chat prompt.

## Generate code from chat

Copilot can generate code blocks in response to your chat prompts. Quickly apply the generated code in your project or insert it in a new file. For example, ask Copilot to optimize an algorithm in your code.

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| <i class="codicon codicon-git-pull-request-go-to-changes"></i> | Smart-apply the generated code block in the active editor. |
| <i class="codicon codicon-insert"></i> | Insert the generated code block at the cursor. |
| <i class="codicon codicon-copy"></i> | Copy the generated code block to the clipboard. |
| <i class="codicon codicon-terminal"></i> | Insert the generated code block in the terminal as a shell command. |
| `Insert into New File` | Insert the generated code block in a new file. |

> **Tips**
>
> - Provide details about the framework or libraries to use.
> - Consider creating [custom code-generation instructions](#customize-ai-code-generation).

## Attach context to your prompt

When you send a chat prompt to Copilot, you can attach context to help Copilot understand your question better. For example, add the current editor selection, a file, or a symbol to your chat prompt. Get more information about [best practices for using Copilot](/docs/copilot/prompt-crafting.md).

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| <i class="codicon codicon-attach"></i> (`kb(workbench.action.chat.attachContext)`) | Open a Quick Pick to select relevant context for your chat prompt. Choose from workspace files, symbols, current editor selection or visible contents, terminal selection or last run command, or the VS Code API.  |
| `#codebase` | Context variable: add relevant workspace content as context to your prompt. |
| `#editor` | Context variable: add the visible contents of the active editor as context for your prompt. |
| `#selection` | Context variable: add the current editor selection as context to your prompt. |
| `#terminalSelection` | Context variable: add the current terminal selection as context to your chat prompt. |
| `#terminalLastCommand` | Context variable: add the last run terminal command as context to your chat prompt. |
| `#VSCodeAPI` | Context variable: add the VS Code API as context to your prompt to ask questions related to VS Code extension development.  |
| `#file` | Open a Quick Pick to select a file from your workspace and add it as context for your prompt. |
| `#<filename>` | Type `#`, followed by a filename, to get filename suggestions for workspace files and attach as context. |
| Drag & drop file | Drag & drop a file or editor onto the chat to attach the file as context. |
| Recent files <i class="codicon codicon-beaker"></i> | Automatically include recently opened and edited files in your chat prompt. [Get more info](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_93#_use-recent-coding-files-as-inline-chat-context-experimental).  |

> **Tips**
>
> - Explicitly include relevant context by selecting code or mentioning chat variables
> - Review the used references in the chat response to ensure that the context is relevant.

## Copilot in the editor

As you're coding in the editor, you can use Copilot to generate code completions as you're typing. Invoke Inline Chat to ask questions and get help from Copilot, while staying in the flow of coding. For example, ask Copilot to generate unit tests for a function or method. Get more information about [code completions](/docs/copilot/ai-powered-suggestions.md) and [Inline Chat](/docs/copilot/copilot-chat.md#inline-chat).

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Code completions | Start typing in the editor and Copilot provides code suggestions that match your coding style and take your existing code into account. |
| Code comments | Provide a code completion prompt to Copilot by writing instructions in a code comment.<br/>Example: `# write a calculator class with methods for add, subtract, and multiply. Use static methods.` |
| `kb(inlinechat.start)` | Start Inline Chat to send a chat request to Copilot directly from the editor. Use natural language or use `/` commands to give instructions to Copilot. |
| Prompt from the editor <i class="codicon codicon-beaker"></i> | Start typing natural language directly in code and Copilot detects that you're not writing code but prompting, and will automatically start Inline Chat for your prompt. |
| `kb(editor.action.rename)` | Get AI-powered suggestions when renaming symbols in your code. |

> **Tips**
>
> - Use meaningful method or function names to get better code completions quicker.
> - Select a code block to scope your Inline Chat prompt or attach relevant context by attaching files or symbols.
> - Use the editor context menu options to access common Copilot actions directly from the editor.

## Customize AI code generation

Copilot can generate code based on your chat prompt. You can customize the generated code by providing instructions to Copilot. For example, you can ask that generated code always uses a specific coding style, such as private variables should always be prefixed with an underscore.

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Code-generation instructions <i class="codicon codicon-beaker"></i> | Define instructions for code generation with GitHub Copilot in settings or import from a file. You can define language-specific instructions. [Get more information](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_93#_code-generation-instructions). |
| Shared instructions <i class="codicon codicon-beaker"></i> | Define shared instructions for code generation in a `.gitHub/copilot-instructions.md` file in your workspace. These common instructions supplement your own personal code generation instructions.  |
| Test-generation instructions <i class="codicon codicon-beaker"></i> | Define instructions for test generation with GitHub Copilot in settings or import from a file. You can define language-specific instructions. [Get more information](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_94#_custom-instructions-experimental). |

> **Tips**
>
> - Define language-specific instructions to get more accurate generated code for each language.
> - Store your instructions in a file to easily share them with your team and across projects.
