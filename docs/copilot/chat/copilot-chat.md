# Use chat in VS Code

Use chat in Visual Studio Code to ask about your codebase or make edits across your project by using natural language. Chat can operate in different modes, optimized for your use case, from asking questions to making multi-file edits or starting an autonomous coding workflow.

You might want to use chat in VS Code when you need to:

* Understand code - "Explain how this authentication middleware works"
* Debug issues - "Why am I getting a null reference in this loop?"
* Get code suggestions - "Show me how to implement a binary search tree in Python"
* Optimize performance - "Help me improve the efficiency of this database query"
* Learn best practices - "What's the recommended way to handle errors in async functions?"
* Get VS Code tips - "How do I customize keyboard shortcuts?"

## Prerequisites

* Install the latest version of [Visual Studio Code](/download)
* Access to [Copilot](/docs/copilot/setup.md). [Copilot Free plan](https://github.com/github-copilot/signup) and get a monthly limit of completions and chat interactions.

## Access chat in VS Code

You can use natural language chat in different ways in VS Code, each optimized for a specific use case and task.

| Experience| Use case | User experience |
|-----------|----------|-----------------|
| **Chat view**<br/>`kb(workbench.action.chat.open)` | Have an ongoing, multi-turn chat conversation in a dedicated view on the side. Switch between different [chat modes](#choose-a-chat-mode) to ask questions, make code edits across files, or start an autonomous coding workflow. | ![Screenshot of the Chat view](images/copilot-chat/chat-view.png) |
| **Inline chat**<br/>`kb(inlineChat.start)` | Start a chat conversation directly from the editor (_editor inline chat_) or integrated terminal (_terminal inline chat_) to get suggestions in-place. | ![Screenshot of the Inline chat](images/copilot-chat/inline-chat.png) |
| **Quick Chat**<br/>`kb(workbench.action.quickchat.toggle)` | Ask a quick question and get back into what you were doing. | ![Screenshot of the Quick Chat](images/copilot-chat/quick-chat.png) |

Access each chat experience by using the corresponding keyboard shortcuts or via the Copilot menu in the VS Code title bar.

![Screenshot of the Copilot Chat menu in the VS Code Command Center](images/copilot-chat/copilot-chat-menu-command-center.png)

## Choose a chat mode

Chat modes are predefined configurations to customize chat in VS Code for specific tasks, such as asking questions, making code edits, or performing autonomous coding tasks. VS Code comes with three built-in chat modes: **Ask**, **Edit**, and **Agent**. You can also define your own chat modes for specific scenarios, such as planning a new feature, or researching implementation options.

To switch between chat modes, open the Chat view (`kb(workbench.action.chat.open)`), and then select the desired mode from the chat mode dropdown list.

![Screenshot showing the Chat view, highlighting the chat mode dropdown list.](images/chat-modes/chat-mode-dropdown.png)

Learn more about [chat modes in VS Code](/docs/copilot/chat/chat-modes.md).

## Change the language model

VS Code offers different built-in language models to choose from. Some models are optimized for fast coding tasks, while others are better suited for slower planning and reasoning tasks. Use the model picker in the chat input field to change the model that Copilot uses for generating a response.

![Screenshot of the chat model picker in the Chat view, showing a dropdown list of available models.](images/copilot-chat/chat-model-picker.png)

You can also add models from other model providers (preview) and use them in chat. Get more details about how to [use models from other providers](/docs/copilot/language-models.md#bring-your-own-language-model-key).

> [!NOTE]
> The list of available models might vary based on your Copilot subscription and might change over time. See the GitHub Copilot documentation for more information about the [available language models](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/ai-models/changing-the-ai-model-for-copilot-chat?tool=vscode).

## Submit a chat prompt

Type a natural language prompt in the chat input box to make chat requests in VS Code. Depending on the chat mode, you can ask questions about your codebase, get code suggestions, or make code edits across multiple files in your project and invoke specialized tools.

A chat response might contain a combination of rich content such as Markdown text, code blocks, buttons, file trees, and more.

![Screenshot of the Chat view in the Secondary Side Bar showing the response to 'explain recursion'.](images/copilot-chat/copilot-chat-view.png)

To get more relevant responses or reference specific files or artifacts in your workspace, such as test failures or terminal output, [add context](#add-chat-context) to your chat prompt by #-mentioning relevant context items.

> [!TIP]
> Enable rendering of mathematical equations in chat responses with the `setting(chat.math.enabled)` setting (preview).

## Add chat context

VS Code tries to determine the intent and scope of the chat request based on your natural language prompt. To help get more relevant responses, provide additional context in your chat prompt, such as files, test results, terminal output, and more.

Use the **Add Context** button in the Chat view or type #-mentions to add context to your chat prompt. For example, type `#codebase` to perform a full codebase search, or `#<file | folder | symbol>` to refer to a specific file, folder, or symbol in your workspace. Type `#` in the chat input field to view the list of context items.

![Screenshot of the Chat view with the context menu open.](images/copilot-chat/chat-add-context.png)

If you have installed MCP servers or extensions that provide tools, you can also directly reference these tools by #-mentioning them in your chat prompt. For example:

* `summarize #fetch code.visualstudio.com/updates`: retrieve the contents of a web page using the `fetch` built-in tool
* `what is terminal suggest #githubRepo microsoft/code`: perform a code search in a GitHub repository using the `githubRepo` built-in tool.

You can also directly reference an agent mode tool in your prompt by typing `#` followed by the tool name. You can do this in all chat modes (ask, edit, and agent mode). For example, use the `#fetch` tool to add the content of a web page as context to your chat prompt, or use `#githubRepo` to perform a code search in a GitHub repository.

Get more details about [adding context to your chat prompt](/docs/copilot/chat/copilot-chat-context.md).

> [!TIP]
> Type `/help` in the chat input field to get help about Copilot and how to interact with chat.

## Vision

Chat supports vision capabilities, which means you can attach an image as context to your chat prompt and ask questions about it. For example, attach a screenshot of a block of code and ask to explain it, or attach a sketch of a UI and ask agent mode to implement it.

> [!TIP]
> You can drag and drop an image from a web browser onto the Chat view to add it as context.

## Chat history

As you iterate and send multiple chat prompts in a chat session, VS Code uses the history of chat prompts and responses as context for your current chat prompt. This means that you can ask follow-up questions or clarify your previous question without having to repeat the context. For example, you can ask "How does *this* differ from ...", "Now add a test case", "explain in more detail", and more.

At any time, you can create a new chat session by using the **New Chat** (`+`) button (`kb(workbench.action.chat.newChat)`) in the Chat view. This can be useful if you want to move to a different topic and avoid the previous context and history.

To view the history of chat sessions, select the **Show Chats...** button in the Chat view or by using the **Chat: Show Chats...** command in the Command Palette. Select a history entry to open that chat session in the Chat view and continue the conversation.

![Screenshot of the Chat view with the Show Chats... button highlighted](images/copilot-chat/copilot-chat-view-show-chats.png)

You can export all prompts and responses for a chat session in a JSON file with the **Chat: Export Chat...** command in the Command Palette. To copy a specific chat prompt or response to the clipboard in Markdown format, right-click the message and select **Copy**. To copy the entire chat session, right-click the Chat view and select **Copy All**.

## Edit a previous chat request (Experimental)

> [!NOTE]
> The ability to edit chat requests is available as of VS Code version 1.102 and is currently an experimental feature.

You can edit a previous chat request in the active chat session. This is useful if you want to refine your prompt or correct a mistake. Editing a chat request is equivalent to reverting the request and then submitting a new request with the edited prompt.

When you edit a previous chat request, the following steps are performed:

1. The edited request and all subsequent requests and responses are removed from the conversation history.
1. Any edits that were made by these requests are reverted to their state before the request was made.
1. The edited request is added to the conversation history and submitted to the language model for a new response.

<video src="images/copilot-chat/chat-edit-request.mp4" title="Video showing the editing of a previous chat request in the Chat view." autoplay loop controls muted></video>

You can configure editing of previous chat request with the `setting(chat.editRequests)` setting:

* `inline`: Select the request in the Chat view to make it editable in-place. Use `kbstyle(Escape)` to exit the edit mode.
* `hover`: Hover over a chat request and select the edit icon (pencil) to make it editable in-place. Use `kbstyle(Escape)` to exit the edit mode.
* `input`: Hover over a chat request and select the edit icon (pencil) to edit the request in the chat input field.
* `none`: Disable editing of chat requests in the Chat view.

### Revert chat requests with checkpoints (Preview)

> [!NOTE]
> Checkpoints are available as of VS Code release 1.103 and are currently in preview.

Chat checkpoints provide a way to restore the state of your workspace to a previous point in time, and are particularly useful when chat interactions resulted in changes across multiple files.

When checkpoints are enabled, VS Code automatically creates snapshots of your files at key points during chat interactions, allowing you to return to a known good state if the changes made by chat requests are not what you expected or if you want to try a different approach.

To enable checkpoints, configure the `setting(chat.checkpoints.enabled)` setting.

#### Restore a checkpoint

When you restore a checkpoint, VS Code reverts the workspace to the state it was in at the time of that checkpoint. This means that _all_ changes made to files after that checkpoint will be undone.

To restore your workspace to a previous checkpoint:

1. In the Chat view, navigate to previous chat request in the chat session.

1. Hover over the chat request and select **Restore Checkpoint**.

    ![Screenshot of the Chat view, showing the Restore Checkpoint action in the Chat view.](images/copilot-chat/chat-restore-checkpoint.png)

1. Confirm that you want to restore the checkpoint and undo any file changes made after that point.

    Notice that the chat request is removed from the conversation history, and the workspace files are restored to their state at the time of the checkpoint.

#### Redo after restoring

After restoring to a previous checkpoint, you can redo the changes that were undone. This might be useful if you inadvertently restored to a checkpoint.

To redo changes after restoring a checkpoint, select **Redo** in the Chat view.

![Screenshot of the Chat view, showing the Redo button to redo the changes after restoring a checkpoint to a previous state.](images/copilot-chat/chat-redo-checkpoint.png)

#### View file changes in checkpoints

To help you understand the impact of each chat request and make it easier to decide which checkpoint to restore to, enable the `setting(chat.checkpoints.showFileChanges)` setting. This shows a list of files that were modified at the end of each chat request, along with the number of lines added and removed in each file.

![Screenshot of the Chat view, showing the file changes at the end of a chat request.](images/copilot-chat/chat-checkpoint-changed-files.png)

## Open chat in an editor tab or separate window

You can open a chat session as a separate editor tab, or even as a separate, floating window. This functionality enables you to have multiple chat sessions open at the same time.

In the Chat view, select the `...` icon in the top-right corner, and then select **Open Chat in Editor** or **Open Chat in New Window**. The following screenshot shows the Chat view running in a floating window:

![Screenshot of the Chat view, highlighting the three-dot menu that contains the Open in Editor and Open in New Window options. The desktop shows a floating window with a chat session.](images/copilot-chat/chat-open-in-new-window.png)

By default, the chat session opens in compact mode, which hides the title bar and other UI elements. Select the compact mode icon in the floating window title bar to toggle between compact and normal mode.

Optionally, enable the **Always on Top** mode to always keep the Chat view on top of other windows.

Learn more about [floating windows](/docs/configure/custom-layout.md#floating-windows) in VS Code.

## Use voice interactions

With the voice control capabilities in VS Code, provided by the [VS Code Speech](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-speech) extension, you can initiate a chat conversation by using your voice:

* Use your voice to dictate your chat prompt
* Use the "Hey Code" voice command to start a voice session with Copilot Chat
* Accelerate voice input for chat by using the "hold to speak" mode

Learn more about how to [use voice interactions in VS Code](/docs/configure/accessibility/voice.md).

## Chat Debug view

The Chat Debug view is a dedicated view where you can see the details of AI requests and responses. For each chat request, you can see the system prompt, user prompt, and details about the context that is sent to the language model. You can view the detailed response from the language model, and responses from tools that are invoked as part of the chat request.

To open the Chat Debug view, run the **Developer: Show Chat Debug View** command from the Command Palette (`kb(workbench.action.showCommands)`).

![Screenshot of the Chat Debug view, showing the details of a chat request and response.](images/copilot-chat/chat-debug-view.png)

## Start chat from the command line

You can start a chat session directly from the command line by using the `chat` subcommand in the VS Code CLI. This enables you to open a chat session in your current working directory with a prompt you provide.

For example, the following command opens chat for the current directory and asks "Find and fix all untyped variables":

```bash
code chat Find and fix all untyped variables
```

The `chat` subcommand has the following command-line options:

* `-m`, `--mode <mode>`: The chat mode to use for the chat session. Available options: `ask`, `edit`, `agent`, or the identifier of a custom mode. Defaults to `agent`.
* `-a`, `--add-file <path>`: Add files as context to the chat session.
* `--maximize`: Maximize the chat session view.
* `-r`, `--reuse-window`: Use the last active window for the chat session.
* `-n`, `--new-window`: Open an empty window for the chat session.

The `chat` subcommand also supports piping input from `stdin` by passing `-` at the end of the command. For example:

```bash
python app.py | code chat why does it fail -
```

## Privacy and transparency

To enable more workspace search features for private repositories, we require additional permissions. If we detect that we don't have these permissions already, we will ask for them at startup. Once granted, we'll securely store the session for the future.

![Modal window asking for additional authentication for a private repository.](images/copilot-chat/authentication.png)

Learn more about security, privacy, and transparency in the [GitHub Copilot Trust Center](https://resources.github.com/copilot-trust-center/).

## Frequently asked questions

### How do I choose between the different chat modes?

The different chat modes are optimized for different use cases:

* Use _editor inline chat_ to ask questions or make edits directly in the active editor. This is useful for making code changes or asking questions that are scoped to the active file.

* Use _ask mode_ to ask questions about your codebase or technology concepts. The response might include code suggestions, which you can apply manually and individually to your codebase. Changes are not automatically applied to your codebase.

* Use _edit mode_ to directly apply edits across multiple files in your codebase based on your chat prompt. You provide the relevant context and files for your prompt.

* Use _agent mode_ to start an autonomous coding workflow, whereby the AI autonomously determines the relevant context and files, determines which tasks need to be performed to complete the request. It then iterates independently to achieve the desired outcome, fixing issues as they come up. Agent mode can invoke [tools](/docs/copilot/chat/chat-agent-mode.md#agent-mode-tools) from extensions or MCP servers to perform specialized tasks, such as running terminal commands, validating test cases, or accessing APIs.
