# Planning in VS Code chat

Agents in Visual Studio Code chat help you execute complex coding tasks autonomously. The plan agent enables you to create detailed implementation plans before starting the implementation to ensure all requirements are met. With todo lists, the agent can ensure it stays focused on the overall goals and tracks progress effectively.

This article explains how to use planning features in VS Code chat, including the plan agent and todo lists.

## Plan agent for autonomous planning

The built-in plan agent helps you create detailed implementation plans before executing complex coding tasks. This ensures that all requirements are considered and addressed before any code changes are made. The plan agent does not make any code changes until the plan is reviewed and approved by you. Once approved, you can hand off the plan to an implementation agent or save the plan for later use.

The plan agent is designed to:

* Research the task comprehensively using read-only tools and codebase analysis to identify requirements and constraints
* Break down the task into manageable, actionable steps and include open questions to ambiguous requirements
* Present a concise plan draft, based on a standardized plan format, for user review and iteration

### Use the plan agent

1. Open the Chat view by pressing `kb(workbench.action.chat.open)` and select **Plan** from the agents dropdown.

1. Enter a high-level prompt that describes what you want to accomplish and submit it.

    For example:
    * "Implement a user authentication system with OAuth2 and JWT"
    * "Add unit tests for all API endpoints"
    * "Refactor the database layer to use the repository pattern"

1. Preview the proposed plan draft and provide feedback for iteration.

    The plan agent provides a high-level summary and a breakdown of steps, including any open questions for clarification.

1. Once finalized, choose to save the plan or hand off to an implementation agent to start coding by using the corresponding controls.

## Track progress with the todo list

> [!NOTE]
> The todo list feature is currently in preview.

When working on complex tasks using agents, VS Code chat creates a todo list to track progress. The todo list breaks down your request into individual tasks and updates automatically as the AI completes each step.

The todo list also helps the agent stay focused on the overall goals by giving it a clear set of tasks to work through. Enable the `todos` tool in the tools picker to enable the model to track its progress using the todo list.

You can configure the visibility of the todo list control in the Chat view with the `setting(chat.agent.todoList.position)` setting.
