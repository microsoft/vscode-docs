# Code completions with GitHub Copilot in VS Code

GitHub Copilot acts as an AI-powered pair programmer, automatically offering suggestions to complete your code, comments, tests, and more. It provides these suggestions directly in the editor while you write your code, and it can work with a broad range of programming languages and frameworks.

Copilot provides two kinds of suggestions:

* **Code completions** - Start typing in the editor, and Copilot provides code suggestions that match your coding style and take your existing code into account.

* **Next Edit Suggestions** - Predict your next code edit with Copilot Next Edit Suggestions, aka Copilot NES. Based on the edits you're making, Copilot NES both predicts the location of the next edit you'll want to make and what that edit should be.

## Getting started

1. Install the GitHub Copilot extensions.

    > <a class="install-extension-btn" href="vscode:extension/GitHub.copilot?referrer=docs-copilot-ai-powered-suggestions">Install the GitHub Copilot extensions</a>

1. Sign in with your GitHub account to use Copilot.

    > [!TIP]
    > If you don't yet have a Copilot subscription, you can use Copilot for free by signing up for the [Copilot Free plan](https://github.com/github-copilot/signup) and get a monthly limit of completions and chat interactions.

1. Discover the key features of Copilot in VS Code with our [Copilot Quickstart](/docs/copilot/getting-started.md).

## Inline suggestions

Copilot offers code suggestions as you type: sometimes the completion of the current line, sometimes a whole new block of code. You can accept all, or part of a suggestion, or you can keep typing and ignore the suggestions.

Notice in the following example how Copilot suggests an implementation of the `calculateDaysBetweenDates` JavaScript function by using dimmed *ghost text*:

![JavaScript ghost text suggestion.](images/inline-suggestions/js-suggest.png)

When you're presented with an inline suggestion, you can accept it with the `kbstyle(Tab)` key.

Copilot tries to apply the same coding style for the code suggestions that you already have in your code. Notice in the following example that Copilot applies the same input parameter naming scheme from the `add` method for the suggested `subtract` method.

![JavaScript ghost text suggestion.](images/inline-suggestions/ts-suggest-parameter-names.png)

### Partially accepting suggestions

You might not want to accept an entire suggestion from GitHub Copilot. You can use the `kb(editor.action.inlineSuggest.acceptNextWord)` keyboard shortcut to accept either the next word of a suggestion, or the next line.

### Alternative suggestions

For any given input, Copilot might offer multiple, alternative suggestions. You can hover over the suggestion to any of the other suggestions.

![Hovering over inline suggestions enables you to select from multiple suggestions](images/inline-suggestions/copilot-hover-highlight.png)

### Generate suggestions from code comments

Instead of relying on Copilot to provide suggestions, you can provide hints about what code you expect by using code comments. For example, you could specify a type of algorithm or concept to use (for example, "use recursion" or "use a singleton pattern"), or which methods and properties to add to a class.

The following example shows how to instruct Copilot to create a class in TypeScript to represent a student, providing information about methods and properties:

![Use code comments to let Copilot generate a Student class in TypeScript with properties and methods.](images/inline-suggestions/ts-suggest-code-comment.png)

## Next Edit Suggestions

Inline suggestions are great at autocompleting a section of code. But since most coding activity is editing existing code, it's a natural evolution of Copilot code completions to also help with edits, both at the cursor and further away. Edits are often not made in isolation - there's a logical flow of what edits need to be made in different scenarios. Copilot Next Edit Suggestions (Copilot NES) is this evolution.

Based on the edits you're making, Copilot NES both predicts the location of the next edit you'll want to make and what that edit should be. Copilot NES helps you stay in the flow, suggesting future changes relevant to your current work, and you can simply `kbstyle(Tab)` to quickly navigate and accept Copilot's suggestions. Suggestions may span a single symbol, an entire line, or multiple lines, depending on the scope of the potential change.

### Navigate and accept edit suggestions

You can quickly navigate suggested code changes with the `kbstyle(Tab)` key, saving you time to find the next relevant edit (no manual searching through files or references required). You can then accept a suggestion with the `kbstyle(Tab)` key again.

An arrow in the gutter indicates if there is an edit suggestion available. You can hover over the arrow to explore the edit suggestion menu, which includes keyboard shortcuts and settings configuration:
![Copilot NES gutter menu expanded](./images/inline-suggestions/gutter-menu-highlighted-updated.png)

If an edit suggestion is below the current editor view, the arrow will point down instead of right:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you are using the VS Code vim extension, you may want to update your `keybindings.json`. Learn more [in the GitHub issue](https://github.com/VSCodeVim/Vim/issues/9459#issuecomment-2648156285).

### Use cases for Next Edit Suggestions

**Catching and correcting mistakes**

* **Copilot helps with simple mistakes like typos.** It'll suggest fixes where letters are missing or swapped, like `cont x = 5` or `conts x = 5`, which should've been `const x = 5`.

    ![Copilot NES fixing a typo from "conts" to "const"](./images/inline-suggestions/nes-typo.gif)

* **Copilot can also help with more challenging mistakes in logic**, like an inverted ternary expression:

    ![Copilot NES fixing a fibonacci logic mistake](./images/inline-suggestions/nes-fib-logic.gif)

    Or a comparison that should've used `&&` instead of `||`:

    ![Copilot NES fixing an if statement mistake](./images/inline-suggestions/nes-de-morgan.gif)

**Changing intent**

* **Copilot suggests changes to the rest of your code that match a new change in intent.** For example, when changing a class from `Point` to `Point3D`, Copilot will suggest to add a `z` variable to the class definition. After accepting the change, Copilot NES next recommends adding `z` to the distance calculation:

    ![Copilot NES gif for updating Point to Point3D](./images/inline-suggestions/nes-point.gif)
    <!-- ![Copilot NES for updating Point to Point3D](./images/inline-suggestions/point3d.png)

    ![Copilot NES for adding z to distance calculation of Point3D](./images/inline-suggestions/point3d-distance.png) -->

**Adding new variables or logic**

* **Using newly added arguments, variables, or functions**. Copilot helps you use new code you just added. This may be a small change, like calling a new method parameter in the actual method.

    It could also be more complex: if you added a new command to your VS Code extension's `extension.ts`, Copilot will first suggest to clean up the command in `extension.ts`. Then when you open `package.json`, Copilot suggests registering that command as well:

    ![Updating extension.ts and package.json with a new command](./images/inline-suggestions/nes-extension-and-package.gif)

    <!-- ![Add command in package.json](./images/inline-suggestions/add-disposable.png)
    ![Add command in package.json](./images/inline-suggestions/call-disposable-full.png) -->

**Refactoring**

* **Rename a variable once in a file, and Copilot will suggest to update it everywhere else.** If you use a new name or naming pattern, Copilot suggests to update subsequent code similarly.

    ![Copilot NES suggesting change after updating function name](./images/inline-suggestions/nes-gutter.gif)

* **Matching code style**. After copy-pasting some code, Copilot will suggest how to adjust it to match the current code where the paste happened.

## Enable or disable code completions

You can enable or disable code completions either for all languages, or for specific languages only.

* To enable or disable code completions, select the Copilot menu in the Status Bar, and then check or uncheck the options to enable or disable code completions.

    ![Screenshot of the Copilot menu in the Status Bar with checkboxes to enabled or disable code completions and NES.](images/inline-suggestions/copilot-menu-status-bar.png)

* Alternatively, modify the `setting(github.copilot.enable)` setting in the Settings editor.

    Add an entry for each language you want to enable or disable code completions for. To enable or disable code completions for all languages, set the value for `*` to `true` or `false`.

### Change the AI model

Different Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on different types of data and might have different capabilities and strengths. Learn more about how to [choose between different AI language models](/docs/copilot/language-models.md) in VS Code.

To change the language model that is used for generating code completions in the editor:

1. Select **Configure Code Completions...** from the Copilot menu in the VS Code title bar.

1. Select **Change Completions Model...**, and then select one of the models from the list.

> [!NOTE]
> The list of available models might vary and change over time. If you are a Copilot Business or Enterprise user, your Administrator needs to enable certain models for your organization by opting in to `Editor Preview Features` in the [Copilot policy settings](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-github-copilot-in-your-organization/managing-policies-for-copilot-in-your-organization#enabling-copilot-features-in-your-organization) on GitHub.com.

## Tips & tricks

### Context

To give you relevant inline suggestions, Copilot looks at the current and open files in your editor to analyze the context and create appropriate suggestions. Having related files open in VS Code while using Copilot helps set this context and lets Copilot get a bigger picture of your project.

## Settings

### Code completions settings

* `setting(github.copilot.enable)` - enable or disable inline completions for all or specific languages.

* `setting(editor.inlineSuggest.fontFamily)` - configure the font for the inline completions.

* `setting(editor.inlineSuggest.showToolbar)` - enable or disable the toolbar that appears for inline completions.

* `setting(editor.inlineSuggest.syntaxHighlightingEnabled)` - enable or disable syntax highlighting for inline completions.

### Next Edit Suggestions settings

* `setting(github.copilot.nextEditSuggestions.enabled)` - enable Copilot Next Edit Suggestions (Copilot NES).

* `setting(editor.inlineSuggest.edits.allowCodeShifting)` - configure if Copilot NES is able to shift your code to show a suggestion.

* `setting(editor.inlineSuggest.edits.renderSideBySide)` - configure if Copilot NES can show larger suggestions side-by-side if possible, or if Copilot NES should always show larger suggestions below the relevant code.

     * **auto (default)**: show larger edit suggestions side-by-side if there is enough space in the viewport, otherwise the suggestions are shown below the relevant code.
     * **never**: never show suggestions side-by-side, always show suggestions below the relevant code.
