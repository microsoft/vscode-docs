    > [!TIP]
    > You can also open the Chat view directly by using the keyboard shortcut `kb(workbench.action.chat.open)` or with the **Chat: Focus on Chat View** command.

1. Select **Sign in to Use Copilot for free** to sign in to your GitHub account. This step also installs the Copilot extensions.

    If you already have a Copilot subscription, you can now start using Copilot in VS Code.

1. If you don't yet have a Copilot subscription, follow the steps in the browser to sign up for the Copilot Free plan

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Telemetry in your free version of GitHub Copilot is currently enabled. By default, code suggestions that match public code, including code references in the VS Code and <github.com> experience, are allowed. You can opt out of telemetry data collection by disabling telemetry in VS Code by setting `setting(telemetry.telemetryLevel)` to `off`, or you can adjust both telemetry and code suggestion settings in [Copilot Settings](https://github.com/settings/copilot).

## Get started with Copilot in VS Code

After you've signed in to your GitHub account and have access to Copilot, start to explore AI-powered coding in VS Code.

1. Verify that the Chat view (`kb(workbench.action.chat.open)`) shows, and that you can enter a prompt in the chat input box.
