## Set up Copilot in VS Code

To use Copilot in VS Code, you need access to a GitHub Copilot subscription. You can set up Copilot directly from within VS Code.

1. Hover over the Copilot icon in the Status Bar and select **Set up Copilot**.

1. Choose a sign-in method and follow the prompts. If you don't have a Copilot subscription yet, you'll be signed up for the [Copilot Free plan](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-copilot-as-an-individual-subscriber/managing-copilot-free/about-github-copilot-free).

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Telemetry in your free version of GitHub Copilot is currently enabled. By default, code suggestions that match public code, including code references in the VS Code and <github.com> experience, are allowed. You can opt out of telemetry data collection by disabling telemetry in VS Code by setting `setting(telemetry.telemetryLevel)` to `off`, or you can adjust both telemetry and code suggestion settings in [Copilot Settings](https://github.com/settings/copilot).

1. You can now start using Copilot in VS Code. Learn the basics with the [Copilot Quickstart](/docs/copilot/getting-started.md).

## Use a different GitHub account with Copilot

If your Copilot subscription is associated with another GitHub account, follow these steps to sign out of your GitHub account in VS Code, and sign in with another account.

1. Select the **Accounts** menu in the Activity Bar, and then select **Sign out** for the account you're currently signed in with.

1. Sign in to your GitHub account using any of the following methods:

    - Select **Sign in to use Copilot** from the Copilot menu in the Status Bar.

        ![Sign in to use Copilot from the Copilot status menu.](images/setup/copilot-signedout-sign-in.png)

    - Select the **Accounts** menu in the Activity Bar, and then select **Sign in with GitHub to use GitHub Copilot**.

        ![Accounts menu in VS Code, showing the option to sign in with GitHub to use GitHub Copilot.](images/setup/vscode-accounts-menu.png)

    - Run the **GitHub Copilot: Sign in** command in the Command Palette (`kb(workbench.action.showCommands)`).

## Remove AI features from VS Code

You can disable the built-in AI features in VS Code with the `setting(chat.disableAIFeatures)` setting, similar to how you configure other features in VS Code. This disables and hides features like chat or inline suggestions in VS Code and disables the Copilot extensions. You can configure the setting at the workspace or user level.

Alternatively, use the **Learn How to Hide AI Features** action from the Chat menu in the title bar to access the setting.

> [!NOTE]
> If you have previously disabled the built-in AI features, your choice is respected upon updating to a new version of VS Code.

## Disable AI features for a workspace

To disable AI features for a specific workspace, configure the `setting(chat.disableAIFeatures)` setting in workspace settings. This setting is available in the Settings editor (`kb(workbench.action.openSettings)`), or you can edit the `settings.json` file in the workspace.
