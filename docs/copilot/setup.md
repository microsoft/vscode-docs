# Set up GitHub Copilot in VS Code

This guide walks you through setting up GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code. To use Copilot in VS Code, you need to have access to GitHub Copilot with your GitHub account and have the Copilot extensions installed in VS Code.

> [!TIP]
> If you don't yet have a Copilot subscription, you can use Copilot for free by signing up for the [Copilot Free plan](https://github.com/github-copilot/signup) and get a monthly limit of completions and chat interactions.

## Get access to GitHub Copilot

There are different ways to get access to GitHub Copilot:

* As an individual, you can sign up to use [Copilot for free](https://github.com/github-copilot/signup), without the need for a credit card. You are entitled to a limited number of completions and chat interactions per month with the free plan, which reset each month. Learn more about the [Copilot Free plan details and conditions](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/about-github-copilot/subscription-plans-for-github-copilot).

* As an individual, sign up for a [paid subscription](https://github.com/github-copilot/signup/copilot_individual) to get unlimited completions and chat interactions. You can try GitHub Copilot for free with a one-time 30-day trial.

* If you are a member of an organization or enterprise that has a subscription to GitHub Copilot, you can request access to Copilot by going to <https://github.com/settings/copilot> and requesting access under "Get Copilot from an organization."

    > [!TIP]
    > You can also open the Chat view directly by using the keyboard shortcut `kb(workbench.action.chat.open)` or with the **Chat: Focus on Chat View** command.

1. Select **Sign in to Use Copilot** to sign in to your GitHub account and get started. This also installs the GitHub Copilot extensions in VS Code.

1. If you don't yet have a Copilot subscription, follow the steps in the browser to sign up for the Copilot Free plan

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Telemetry in your free version of GitHub Copilot is currently enabled. By default, code suggestions that match public code, including code references in the VS Code and <github.com> experience, are allowed. You can opt out of telemetry data collection by disabling telemetry in VS Code by setting `setting(telemetry.telemetryLevel)` to `off`, or you can adjust both telemetry and code suggestion settings in [Copilot Settings](https://github.com/settings/copilot).

## Get started with Copilot in VS Code

After you've signed in to your GitHub account and have access to Copilot, start to explore AI-powered coding in VS Code.

1. Verify that the Chat view (`kb(workbench.action.chat.open)`) shows, and that you can enter a prompt in the chat input box.
