# GitHub Copilot extensibility in VS Code

You can extend GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code to expand the functionality of Copilot Chat or to take advantage of Copilot's Large Language Model (LLM) to build AI features into your extension. In this article, you learn about the different ways to extend Copilot in your VS Code extension and how to get started.

## About Copilot extensibility in VS Code

The basis for extending Copilot in VS Code is building a VS Code extension. There are different ways in which you can extend Copilot in your VS Code extension:

- **VS Code Chat extension**: use the Chat API to create a chat participant that gives users a natural-language interface and provides domain-specific help via the Chat view in VS Code. Optionally, you can use the Copilot LLM to interpret user prompts and generate responses.

- **Use Copilot's LLM**: use the Language Model API and the VS Code extension APIs to build AI-powered features into your extension and enhance editor-specific interactions.

Alternatively, you can also build a **Copilot Extension**, implemented as a GitHub App with additional capabilities. Copilot Extensions work across all supported IDEs and GitHub, but don't have access to functionalities specific to VS Code. Get more info about [Copilot Extensions](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/building-copilot-extensions/about-building-copilot-extensions) in the GitHub documentation.

## Use cases

You can extend the capabilities of Copilot in VS Code in various ways. For example, you could use them for:

- Docs querying: A chat participant could allow Copilot Chat to use Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to query a third-party documentation service and generate responses based on the retrieved information.
- AI-assisted coding: Use the Copilot LLM to provide editor annotations to provide coding suggestions.
- AI-powered reviews: Use the Copilot LLM to review your code for security vulnerabilities or performance improvements.
- Data retrieval: A chat participant could allow Copilot Chat to query a database or third-party data service to retrieve information about a specific topic.
- Enterprise coding assistant: a chat participant that is grounded in the data of your enterprise and that is aware of the specific coding guidelines your company follows.
- Enhance extensions: Use the Language Model API to add AI-powered features to your existing VS Code extensions.
