# Default settings reference

Visual Studio Code comes with a set of default settings that can be overridden by user or workspace settings. You can change the default settings by using the Settings editor or by editing the `settings.json` file directly.

To view the list of default settings, run the **Preferences: Open Default Settings (JSON)** command from the Command Palette (`kb(workbench.action.showCommands)`). This opens a read-only file named `defaultSettings.json` that contains all the default settings in JSON format.
