# Color Themes

Color themes let you modify the colors in Visual Studio Code's user interface to suit your preferences and work environment.

![Preview themes from the Command Palette](images/themes/themes_hero.gif)

## Selecting the Color Theme

1. In VS Code, open the Color Theme picker with **File** > **Preferences** > **Color Theme**. (**Code** > **Preferences** > **Color Theme** on macOS).
2. You can also use the keyboard shortcut `kb(workbench.action.selectTheme)` to display the picker.
3. Use the cursor keys to preview the colors of the theme.
4. Select the theme you want and press `kbstyle(Enter)`.

![Themes in the Command Palette](images/themes/colorthemes.png)

The active color theme is stored in your user [settings](/docs/getstarted/settings.md) (keyboard shortcut `kb(workbench.action.openSettings)`).

```json
  // Specifies the color theme used in the workbench.
  "workbench.colorTheme": "Default Dark+"
```

> **Tip:** By default, the theme is stored in your user settings and applies globally to all workspaces. You can also configure a workspace specific theme. To do so, set a theme in the Workspace [settings](/docs/getstarted/settings.md#workspace-settings).

## Color Themes from the Marketplace

There are several out-of-the-box color themes in VS Code for you to try.

Many more themes have been uploaded to the VS Code [Extension Marketplace](/docs/editor/extension-marketplace.md) by the community.  If you find one you want to use, install it and restart VS Code and the new theme will be available.

You can search for themes in the Extensions view (`kb(workbench.view.extensions)`) search box using the `@category:"themes"` filter.

## Auto switch based on OS color scheme

Windows and macOS support light and dark color schemes. There is a setting, `window.autoDetectColorScheme`, that instructs VS Code to listen to changes to the OS's color scheme and switch to a matching theme accordingly.

To customize the themes that are used when a color scheme changes, you can set the preferred light, dark, and high contrast themes with the settings:

* `workbench.preferredLightColorTheme` - defaults to "Default Light+"
* `workbench.preferredDarkColorTheme` - defaults to "Default Dark+"
* `workbench.preferredHighContrastColorTheme` - defaults to "Default High Contrast"
* `workbench.preferredHighContrastLightColorTheme` - defaults to "Default High Contrast Light"

## Customizing a Color Theme

### Workbench colors

You can customize your active color theme with the `workbench.colorCustomizations` and `editor.tokenColorCustomizations` user [settings](/docs/getstarted/settings.md).

To set the colors of VS Code UI elements such as list & trees (File Explorer, suggestions widget), diff editor, Activity Bar, notifications, scroll bar, split view, buttons, and more, use `workbench.colorCustomizations`.

![activity bar theming](images/themes/theme-activitybar.gif)

You can use IntelliSense while setting `workbench.colorCustomizations` values or, for a list of all customizable colors, see the [Theme Color Reference](/api/references/theme-color.md).

To customize a specific theme only, use the following syntax:

```json
"workbench.colorCustomizations": {
    "[Monokai]": {
        "sideBar.background": "#347890"
    }
}
```

If a customization applies to more than one themes, you can name multiple themes or use `*` as wildcard at the beginning and the end of the name:

```json
"workbench.colorCustomizations": {
    "[Abyss][Red]": {
        "activityBar.background": "#ff0000"
    },
    "[Monokai*]": {
        "activityBar.background": "#ff0000"
    }
}
```

### Editor syntax highlighting

To tune the editor's syntax highlighting colors, use `editor.tokenColorCustomizations` in your user [settings](/docs/getstarted/settings.md) `settings.json` file:

![Token Color Customization](images/themes/token_color_customization.png)

A pre-configured set of syntax tokens ('comments', 'strings', ...) is available for the most common constructs. If you want more, you can do so by directly specifying TextMate theme color rules:

![Advanced Token Color Customization](images/themes/token_color_customization_advanced.png)

>**Note**: Directly configuring TextMate rules is an advanced skill as you need to understand on how TextMate grammars work. Go to the [Color Theme guide](/api/extension-guides/color-theme.md) for more information.

Again, to customize specific themes, you can do this in one of the following ways:

```json
"editor.tokenColorCustomizations": {
    "[Monokai]": {
        "comments": "#229977"
    },
    "[*Dark*]": {
        "variables": "#229977"
    },
    "[Abyss][Red]": {
        "keywords": "#f00"
    }
}
```

### Editor semantic highlighting

Some languages (currently: TypeScript, JavaScript, Java) provide semantic tokens. Semantic tokens are based on the language service's symbol understanding and are more accurate than the syntax tokens coming from the TextMate grammars that are driven by regular expressions. The semantic highlighting that is computed from the semantic tokens goes on top of syntax highlighting and can correct and enrich the highlighting as seen in the following example:

The "Tomorrow Night Blue" color theme without semantic highlighting:

![without semantic highlighting](images/themes/no-semantic-highlighting.png)

The "Tomorrow Night Blue" color theme with semantic highlighting:

![with semantic highlighting](images/themes/with-semantic-highlighting.png)

Notice the color differences based on language service symbol understanding:

* line 10: `languageModes` is colored as a parameter.
* line 11: `Range` and `Position` are colored as classes and `document` as a parameter.
* line 13: `getFoldingRanges` is colored as a function.

The settings `editor.semanticHighlighting.enabled` serves as the main control on whether semantic highlighting is applied. It can have values `true`, `false`, and `configuredByTheme`.

* `true` and `false` turn semantic highlighting on or off for all themes.
* `configuredByTheme` is the default and lets each theme control whether semantic highlighting is enabled or not. All the themes that ship with VS Code (for example, the "Dark+" default) have semantic highlighting enabled by default.

Users can override the theme setting by:

```json
"editor.semanticTokenColorCustomizations": {
    "[Rouge]": {
        "enabled": true
    }
}
```

When semantic highlighting is enabled and available for a language, it is up to the theme to configure whether and how semantic tokens are colored. Some semantic tokens are standardized and map to well-established TextMate scopes. If the theme has a coloring rule for these TextMate scopes, the semantic token will be rendered with that color, without the need for any additional coloring rules.

Additional styling rules can be configured by the user in `editor.semanticTokenColorCustomizations"`:

```json
"editor.semanticTokenColorCustomizations": {
    "[Rouge]": {
        "enabled": true,
        "rules": {
            "*.declaration": { "bold": true }
        }
    }
}
```

To see what semantic tokens are computed and how they are styled, users can use the scope inspector (**Developer: Inspect Editor Tokens and Scopes**), which displays information for the text at the current cursor position.

![scope inspector](images/themes/semantic-highlighting-scope-inspector.png)

If semantic tokens are available for the language at the given position and enabled by theme, the inspect tool shows a section `semantic token type`. The section shows the semantic token information (type and any number of modifiers) as well as the styling rules that apply.

More information on semantic tokens and styling rule syntax can be found in the [Semantic Highlighting Guide](/api/language-extensions/semantic-highlight-guide.md).

## Creating your own Color Theme

Creating and publishing a theme extension is easy. Customize your colors in your user settings then generate a theme definition file with the **Developer: Generate Color Theme From Current Settings** command.

VS Code's Yeoman [extension generator](/api/get-started/your-first-extension.md) will help you generate the rest of the extension.

See the [Create a new Color Theme](/api/extension-guides/color-theme.md#create-a-new-color-theme) topic in our Extension API section to learn more.

## Remove default Color Themes

If you'd like to remove some of the default themes shipped with VS Code from the Color Theme picker, you can disable them from the Extensions view (`kb(workbench.view.extensions)`). Click the **Filter Extensions** button from the top of the Extensions view, select the **Built-in** option, and you'll see a **THEMES** section listing the default themes.

![built-in themes](images/themes/built-in-themes.png)

You can disable a built-in theme extension as you would any other VS Code [extension](/docs/editor/extension-marketplace.md) with the **Disable** command on the gear context menu.

![disable theme](images/themes/disable-theme.png)

## File Icon Themes

File icon themes can be contributed by extensions and selected by users as their favorite set of file icons. File icons are shown in the File Explorer and tabbed headings.

### Selecting the File Icon Theme

1. In VS Code, open the File Icon Theme picker with **File** > **Preferences** > **File Icon Theme**. (**Code** > **Preferences** > **File Icon Theme** on macOS).
2. You can also use the **Preferences: File Icon Theme** command from the **Command Palette** (`kb(workbench.action.showCommands)`).
3. Use the cursor keys to preview the icons of the theme.
4. Select the theme you want and hit `kbstyle(Enter)`.

![file icon theme dropdown](images/themes/file-icon-theme-dropdown.png)

By default, the **Seti** file icon set is used and those are the icons you see in the File Explorer. Once a file icon theme is selected, the selected theme will be remembered and appear again whenever VS Code is restarted. You can disable file icons by selecting **None**.

VS code ships with two file icon themes; **Minimal** and **Seti**. To install more file icon themes, select the **Install Additional File Icon Themes** item in the file icon theme picker and you'll see a query for file icon themes (tag:icon-theme) in the Extensions view.

You can also browse the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/vscode/Themes) site directly to find available themes.

The active File Icon theme is persisted in your user [settings](/docs/getstarted/settings.md) (keyboard shortcut `kb(workbench.action.openSettings)`).

```json
  // Specifies the file icon theme used in the workbench.
  "workbench.iconTheme": "vs-seti"
```

## Creating your own File Icon Theme

You can create your own File Icon Theme from icons (preferably SVG), see the [File Icon Theme](/api/extension-guides/file-icon-theme.md) topic in our Extension API section for details.
