# Testing TypeScript

Visual Studio Code supports testing TypeScript through it's testing framework. You will need to have a right testing extension based on the testing framework that your project uses.

## Mocha

## Playwright

## Jest

## Vitest


[Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) is an ESM-first, modern unit-test framework powered by Vite. It works out of the box for TypeScript/Node.js projects. You can learn how to get started and read about its features in [the Vitest guide](https://vitest.dev/guide/). To enhance your VS Code experience, you can install [the official VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ZixuanChen.vitest-explorer).
