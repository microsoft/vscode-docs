# Coding Packs

As educators, we know it's frustrating to install all the different software to get your students ready to code. There's editors/IDEs, runtimes and compilers, packages or libraries, and different versions of each...it's annoying! We've got you covered.

This coding pack includes everything you need to start coding in Java.

If any of these components are already installed, the coding packs will not update it and proceed with the other components.

In the Coding Pack for Python, we will include a User-level `settings.json` with a few pre-configured Python settings so you're all ready to start coding in Python!
