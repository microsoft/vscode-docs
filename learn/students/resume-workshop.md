# Create a resume website - no coding experience required

This recruiting season, make your resume stand out by hosting it on your very own webpage. This workshop will walk you through how to create a resume webpage entirely in the browser using HTML, CSS, github.dev, and GitHub Pages. Having an online resume will help recruiters notice your application, and you'll be able to learn a few new skills in the process. The best part is that you won't need to download any coding tools or languages to get started.
