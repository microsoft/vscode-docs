# Learn Python with Over The Moon

[Over the Moon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26DIABx44Tw) is a Netflix film about Fei Fei, a young girl who builds a rocket to go to the moon on a mission to prove the existence of a legendary Moon Goddess. These lessons were inspired by Fei Fei's story and the story of real NASA engineers and astronauts. Try out these space-travel themed challenges that will introduce you to data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence with tools like Python, Visual Studio Code, and Azure.

Get a glimpse into the Python programming language with this introductory learning path that requires no prior background.
