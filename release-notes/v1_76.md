## Accessibility

### Context specific tab focus mode

The **Toggle Tab Key Moves Focus** command is useful for determining whether the workbench or editor/terminal receive `kbstyle(Tab)` key input.

We have added `editor.tabFocusMode` and `terminal.integrated.tabFocusMode` settings to allow users to control this by default.

### Improved error audio cue responsiveness

The `audioCues.lineHasError` audio cue now plays during character navigation so that screen reader users have improved insight into where the errors are in the editor.

### Terminal accessible buffer improvements

Last iteration, we introduced the terminal accessible buffer, which provides screen reader users access to the terminal contents via the **Terminal: Focus Accessible Buffer** command.

This iteration, we've improved the accessible buffer by adding selection and link support, making it read-only, and using shell integration insights to limit output to only the important terminal content - the command that was run, the exit code if any, and the output. We plan to allow configuring this next iteration.

### Terminal command failure audio cue

When a command exits with a non-zero code in a terminal with shell integration, sighted users can glance at the command decoration to quickly understand this. To convey this information to screen reader users, VS Code now plays `audioCues.terminalCommandFailed`.

### Screen reader shell integration support on Windows

Shell integration was previously disabled when a screen reader was detected on Windows due to problems with PowerShell support in this context. We have determined that this is no longer an issue in most cases, so have enabled it.

### Terminal accessible help additions

Discussions with the screen reader community have yielded additions to the **Terminal Accessibility Help** dialog (`kb(workbench.action.terminal.showAccessibilityHelp)`).

## Profiles

Profiles, [released to Stable](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_75#_profiles) last milestone, let you quickly switch VS Code configurations depending on your current workflow and project. You can save a set of customizations such as settings, extensions, and keybindings, sync them across your machines, and easily share them with colleagues.

### Profile Badge

VS Code now indicates the current custom profile by showing the first two letters of the profile name as a profile badge on the Activity bar icon.

![Profile Badge](images/1_76/profile-badge.png)

### Switch profiles

You can now quickly switch between profiles with the **Profiles: Switch Profile** command in the Command Palette (`kb(workbench.action.showCommands)`), which will present a dropdown listing your available profiles.

![Switch Profile command drop down listing available profiles](images/1_76/switch-profile.png)

### Profiles in Remote Workspaces

You can now create and customize profiles including remote extensions and switch between them in remote workspaces.

![Remote Profiles](images/1_76/remote-profiles.png)

### Profiles documentation

Check out the new [Profiles](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/profiles) topic if you'd like to learn more about profiles and scenarios when they are useful. This article goes into detail on how to create, modify, share, and reuse profiles.

## Workbench

### Moveable Explorer view

The Explorer view (`kb(workbench.view.explorer)`), like many other views in VS Code, can now be moved into the secondary side bar or the bottom panel to allow for further workbench customization.

### Fixed-width centered layout

The centered layout **View: Toggle Central Layout** command (`workbench.action.toggleCenteredLayout`) now has a fixed-width layout option. This option is enabled with the new `workbench.editor.centeredLayoutFixedWidth` setting. When enabled and centered layout is active, the editor will be centered and attempt to maintain its width across window and panel resizes.

### Multiple quick diffs

With the introduction of the proposed [multiple quick diff API](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/blob/main/release-notes/v1_75.md#quick-diff), multiple extensions can provide a quick diff. When there are multiple quick diffs in a file, you'll now see a dropdown to choose which diff base to view:

![Multiple quick diffs](images/1_76/multiple-quick-diff.png)

### Comments

The **Comments** view has a new **Expand All** command to go with the existing **Collapse All**. The gutter icon for unresolved comments is now the same icon that is used in the **Comments** view.

### Configure Default Log Level

You can now configure the default log level for VS Code or for an extension from the **Developer: Set Log Level...** command. This is persisted across restarts and is synced across machines.

![Default Log Level](images/1_76/default-log-level.png)

### Verified Publisher Domain in Extension Editor

The extension editor now displays the verified publisher domain next to the veirified indicator.

![Verified Publisher Domain](images/1_76/verified-publisher-domain.png)

## Editor

### JSONC document sorting

It is now possible to sort JSONC (JSON documents with comments) files by key. To use this feature, select **JSON: Sort document** from the Command Palette.

### Independent bracket pairs for matching and colorization

In this iteration, we changed the behavior when both `editor.language.brackets` and `editor.language.colorizedBracketPairs` are configured. Before, setting `editor.language.colorizedBracketPairs` would override `editor.language.brackets` for bracket matching (as both use the same [bracket pair tree](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2021/09/29/bracket-pair-colorization#_the-basic-algorithm)). Now, the union of both settings is used for bracket matching, but only brackets configured in `editor.language.colorizedBracketPairs` are colorized.

## Terminal

## Source Control

### Git

VS Code has adopted a new Git grammar, which provides syntax highlighting for Git commit message files. The new grammar has better support for languages other than English.

### New documentation

Whether you are new to source control or an experienced Git user, you can learn more about VS Code's Git integration in the [Source Control](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/overview) section of our documentation. Topics include:

* [Using Git source control in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/overview) - An overview of VS Code's Git integration features.
* [Introduction to Git](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/intro-to-git) - Beginner level Git operations in VS Code.
* [Working with GitHub](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/github) - Move your code to [GitHub](https://github.com) to share and collaborate with others.
* [Frequently Asked Questions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/faq) - Answers to common scenarios and gotchas.

## Notebooks

### Notebook renderer performance diagnostics

When running notebook cells, some notebook output renderers may take a long time to render. To help identify these renderers, we've added some diagnostics to the hover in the notebook cell Status bar. This view shows the time it took to for each renderer to execute and the total execution time. Additionally, the links in the hover will open the issue reporter with the renderer's name and execution time pre-filled so that you can easily file an issue if you find the renderer is taking too long to execute.

![image showing the cell Status bar hover with renderer execution times](images/1_76/notebook-renderer-performance-diagnostics.png)

### Kernel picker default mode: MRU

The kernel picker now shows the most recently used kernel by default. This is a change from the previous behavior, which was to show all available kernels to users. You can still see all available kernels by a secondary picker **Select Another Kernel...**, which will group all kernels by their source (for example: Jupyter Kernel, Python Environment, etc.) when you have latest [Jupyter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter) and [Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) extensions installed.

![Notebook Kernel Picker](images/1_75/noterbook-kernel-picker.gif)

### Better link support for builtin Error Renderer

The builtin Error Renderer now supports links to files and line numbers. This allows you to click on a file path in the error message and open the file in the editor.

Jupyter extension's Error Renderer is now removed in favor of the builtin Error Renderer.

![Notebook builtin error renderer](images/1_76/notebook-error-renderer.gif)

## Debugging

## Languages

### Markdown workspace header link completions

Need to link to a header in another Markdown document but don't remember or want to type out the full file path? Try using workspace header completions! To start, just type `##` in a Markdown link to see a list of all Markdown headers from the current workspace:

![Suggestions for all Markdown headers in the current workspace](images/1_76/md-workspace-header-suggestion.png)

Accept one of these completions to insert the full link to that header, even if it's in another file:

![Adding a link to the selected header in another file](images/1_76/md-workspace-header-suggestion-insert.png)

You can configure if/when workspace header completions show with the `markdown.suggest.paths.includeWorkspaceHeaderCompletions` setting. Valid setting values are:

- `onDoubleHash` (the default) — Show workspace header completions only after you type `##`.
- `onSingleOrDoubleHash` — Show workspace header completions after you type `#` or `##`.
- `never` — Never show workspace header completions.

Keep in mind that finding all headers in the current workspace can be expensive, so there may be a slight delay the first time they are requested, especially for workspaces with lots of Markdown files.

### Configure preferred file extension style for Markdown links
The new `markdown.preferredMdPathExtensionStyle` setting configures if VS Code prefers using file extensions for links to Markdown files. This preference is used for language tools such as [path completions](/docs/languages/markdown.md#path-completions) and [link renames](/docs/languages/markdown.md#rename-headers-and-links).

Valid setting values are:

- `auto` — Try to preserve the existing style of the file extension.
- `includeExtension` — Include the trailing `.md` in the link.
- `removeExtension` — Remove the trailing `.md` from the link.


## Extensions

## Remote Development

The [Remote Development extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack), allow you to use a [Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers), remote machine via SSH or [Remote Tunnels](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/tunnels), or the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl) (WSL) as a full-featured development environment. <!-- Highlights of this release include: -->

<!-- * TBD -->

You can learn about new extension features and bug fixes in the [Remote Development release notes](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/blob/main/remote-release-notes/v1_76.md).

### Remote indicator

This milestone we made several usability improvements to the remote indicator (visible in the lower left of the Status bar):

1. There is now a default keybinding to open the remote indicator menu: `kb(workbench.action.remote.showMenu)`.

   <video src="images/1_76/remote-indicator.mp4" placeholder="images/1_76/remote-indicator.mp4" autoplay loop controls muted title="Opening the remote indicator menu with the new default keybinding">
    Sorry, your browser doesn't support HTML 5 video.
   </video>

2. We reduced our remote extensions' contributions to the remote indicator to make it easy to view all actions for connecting to a remote window at a glance.
   * Basic actions for opening a remote window are now always available in the remote indicator, so you can discover actions to connect to another remote even when you are already in a remote window.
   * Most actions for configuring or getting started with a remote have moved from the remote indicator menu to the command palette to conserve space in the remote indicator.

3. The **Install Additional Remote Extensions** option in the remote indicator now points to a list of curated Remote Development extensions and is hidden from the remote indicator menu if all such extensions are already installed.

### Remote Repositories

This milestone, we introduced the **Browse & Edit Remote Repositories without Cloning** walkthrough in the [Remote Repositories](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.remote-repositories) extension to help you search, edit, and create quick commits in GitHub and Azure Repos without cloning locally.

You can also check out the [Remote Repositories tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2021/06/10/remote-repositories) to help you get started.

## VS Code for the Web

This milestone we have added experimental readonly support for [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com/)-tracked files hosted in GitHub and Azure Repos repositories on [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev).

In the short video below, images stored on Git LFS in the vscode-docs repository are visible when scrolling the Markdown Preview on vscode.dev.

<video src="images/1_76/web-git-lfs.mp4" placeholder="images/1_76/web-git-lfs.mp4" autoplay loop controls muted title="Viewing a Markdown preview of a file containing Git LFS image references in vscode.dev">
    Sorry, your browser doesn't support HTML 5 video.
</video>

When you view a file in a GitHub or Azure Repos repository, based on your `.gitattributes` configuration, we detect whether the file is LFS-tracked and needs to be fetched from GitHub's or Azure Repos's LFS servers.

You can also use the [GitHub Repositories](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.remotehub) and [Azure Repos](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.azure-repos) extensions with VS Code Desktop to browse repositories containing Git LFS-tracked files without cloning.

This behavior can be disabled with the following settings:

* `"githubRepositories.experimental.lfs.read.enabled": false`
* `"azureRepos.experimental.lfs.read.enabled": false`

VS Code does not yet support committing Git LFS-tracked files, and [github.dev](https://github.dev) does not have Git LFS read support.

## Contributions to extensions

### Jupyter

#### IPyWidgets

The [Jupyter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter) extension now supports version `8` of [IPyWidgets](https://pypi.org/project/ipywidgets/#description). Python Widgets relying on `IPyWidgets 7.*` will continue work, as both versions `7.*` and `8.*` are supported.

### Python

#### Improved IntelliSense support for pytest with Pylance

The [Pylance](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.vscode-pylance) extension now has powerful features that can help you work more efficiently and effectively when writing and maintaining clear, concise, and easy to understand tests with [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org):

* Support for completions, **Go to Definition**, **Find All References**, and **Rename Symbol** (F2) for pytest fixtures and parameterized arguments.
* Type annotation support for pytest parameters through inlay hints (enabled by the ``"python.analysis.inlayHints.pytestParameters"`` setting) and through Code Actions.
* Type inference of parameterized pytest arguments, based on the parameter values provided to the decorator.

The short video below highlights these new pytest features:

<video src="images/1_76/pylance-pytest-intellisense.mp4" placeholder="images/1_76/pylance-pytest-intellisense.mp4" autoplay loop controls muted title="Showcasing new pytest IntelliSense features">
      Sorry, your browser doesn't support HTML 5 video.
</video>

#### Interactive Window kernel selection

Auto-selecting a kernel for the Interactive Window was modified to work better with the new kernel picker UI. The current active interpreter is used unless another kernel was previously chosen for an Interactive Window in that workspace, in which case the previously selected kernel is used.

### GitHub Pull Requests and Issues

There has been more progress on the [GitHub Pull Requests and Issues](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github) extension, which allows you to work on, create, and manage pull requests and issues. Highlights include:

* Permalink rendering in the PR description and in comments.
* Re-requesting reviews from the description page.
* Quick diffs for files in a checked-out PR.

Check out the [changelog for the 0.60.0](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-pull-request-github/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#0600) release of the extension to see the other highlights.

## Preview features

### Rich content notebook search

Global search now supports showing results from notebooks as they would be displayed in the notebook editor. Enable `search.experimental.notebookSearch` to try this out, and let us know about any bugs that you run into! This currently only supports searching cell inputs and Markdown sources in cells.

<video src="images/1_76/experimental_notebook_search.mp4" placeholder="images/1_76/experimental_notebook_search.mp4" autoplay loop controls muted title="Notebook rich content search demo">
    Sorry, your browser doesn't support HTML 5 video.
</video>

### Asynchronous tokenization

This release ships the experimental asynchronous tokenization feature. This feature allows the editor to tokenize documents in a separate web worker, which can improve the responsiveness of the editor when the document is large.

For now, asynchronous tokenization is disabled by default and can be enabled by setting `editor.experimental.asyncTokenization` to `true`.

### TypeScript 5.0 support

This update includes support for the upcoming TypeScript 5.0 release. See the [TypeScript 5.0 Beta blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-5-0-beta/) and  [TypeScript 5.0 iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/51362) for more details on what the TypeScript team is currently working on. Some editor tooling highlights:

* New `switch` and `case` completions help you fill in both sections of `switch` statements more quickly.
* Work on enabling project wide IntelliSense on [github.dev](https://github.dev) and [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev).

To start using the TypeScript 5.0 nightly builds, install the [TypeScript Nightly](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-typescript-next) extension or install the latest [VS Code 1.76+ Insiders build](/insiders).

## Extension authoring

### Link support in InputBox prompts and validation messages

This iteration, we introduced support for links in `InputBox` prompts and validation messages. In those strings, you can now use the following syntax to create links:

```ts
[link text](link target)
```

The link target can be a URL or a command ID. When the user clicks on the link, the link target will be opened in the browser or executed as a command, respectively.

Example:

```ts
const result = await vscode.window.showInputBox({
   prompt: 'Please enter a valid email address [more info](https://aka.ms/vscode-email-validation)',
   validateInput: text => {
      if (text.indexOf('@') === -1) {
         return 'Please enter a valid email address, [more info](https://aka.ms/vscode-email-validation)';
      }
      return undefined;
   }
});
```

which will result in the following prompt:

![Prompt contains a link that is underlined](images/1_76/quickpick-prompt-links.png)

and the following validation message:

![Validation message contains a link that is underlined](images/1_76/quickpick-validation-links.png)

_Theme: [Panda Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tinkertrain.theme-panda) (preview on [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev/theme/tinkertrain.theme-panda))_

This behavior works for both `showInputBox` and `createInputBox` APIs.

### Information diagnostic for * activation event

When an extension uses the `*` (star) activation event, it will be activated while VS Code is in the process of starting up. This can cause a delay in the startup time of VS Code. To help extension authors understand the impact of using the `*` activation event, we have added an information diagnostic that will be shown when an extension uses the `*` activation event. The diagnostic will be shown in the Problems view and will also be shown in the extension editor:

![diagnostic for * activation event](images/1_76/star-activation.png)

For more information about `*` (star) activation, please see the [Activation Events](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/activation-events#Start-up) documentation.

## Proposed APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always, we want your feedback. Here are the steps to try out a proposed API:

1. [Find a proposal that you want to try](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/tree/main/src/vscode-dts) and add its name to `package.json#enabledApiProposals`.
1. Use the latest [vscode-dts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vscode-dts) and run `vscode-dts dev`. It will download the corresponding `d.ts` files into your workspace.
1. You can now program against the proposal.

You cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. There may be breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.

### OpenDialogOptions allowUIResources

Extensions that are aware that they are running in a remote extension host can use `allowUIResources` to cause the **Show local** button to display in open file dialogs. Extensions that use `allowUIResources` should always check the scheme of the URI that's returned.

### Tooltips for QuickPickItems

This iteration we are introducing a new proposed API for a `tooltip` property for `QuickPickItem`s. This property allows you to specify a tooltip for each item in a Quick Pick. The tooltip will be displayed when the user hovers over the item or it can be toggled with `Ctrl+Space`.

Example:

```ts
await vscode.window.showQuickPick([
   {
      label: 'label',
      tooltip: 'tooltip',
   },
   {
      label: 'label2',
      tooltip: new vscode.MarkdownString('tooltip2 [link](https://github.com)'),
   }
], {
   placeHolder: 'placeholder'
});
```

which will result in the following Quick Pick:

<video src="images/1_76/quickpick-tooltip.mp4" placeholder="images/1_76/quickpick-tooltip.mp4" autoplay loop controls muted title="Quick Pick with tooltips">
    Sorry, your browser doesn't support HTML 5 video.
</video>

_Theme: [Panda Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tinkertrain.theme-panda) (preview on [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev/theme/tinkertrain.theme-panda))_

Obviously, this is a simple example that doesn't need a tooltip. Tooltips are useful when you want to provide long descriptions that might have multiple lines or links to additional resources.

We think that this API is a good addition to the Quick Pick API and we are looking forward to your feedback.

## Engineering

### More Electron `UtilityProcess` adoption

As part of our [process sandbox journey](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2022/11/28/vscode-sandbox) we want to make sure that there is no more node.js enabled browser window in our application. This milestone we started to convert our last remaining process from a hidden node.js browser window to a Electron [`UtilityProcess`](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/api/utility-process). As part of this work, the file watcher process had to move out into its own utility process as well.

A new setting `window.experimental.sharedProcessUseUtilityProcess` allows to enable the use of `UtilityProcess` and we plan to make this the default in the next release.

## Notable fixes

* [168939](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/168939) Persist state of badge hiding across reloads and view moves.
* [164397](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/164397) Layout control in the wrong place for RTL macOS.
