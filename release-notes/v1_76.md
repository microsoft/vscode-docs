# February 2023 (version 1.76)

<!-- DOWNLOAD_LINKS_PLACEHOLDER -->

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the February 1.76 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the February milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/main)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22February+2023%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.

## Accessibility

### Context specific tab focus mode

The `Toggle Tab Key Moves Focus` command is useful for determining whether the workbench or editor/terminal receive tab key input.

We have added `editor.tabFocusMode` and `terminal.integrated.tabFocusMode` settings to allow users to control this by default.

### Improved error audio cue responsiveness

We now play `audioCues.lineHasError` during character navigation so that screen reader users have improved insight into where the errors are in the editor.

### Terminal accessible buffer improvements

Last iteration, we introduced the terminal accessible buffer, which provides screen reader users access to the terminal contents via `Terminal: Focus Accessible Buffer`.

This iteration, we've improved the accessible buffer by adding selection & link support, making it readonly, and leveraging shell integration insights to provide only the important terminal content - the command that was run, the exit code if any, and the output. We plan to allow configuring this next iteration.

### Terminal command failure audio cue

When a command exits with a non-zero code in a terminal with shell integration, sighted users can glance at the command decoration to quickly understand this. To convey this information to screen reader users, we now play `audioCues.terminalCommandFailed`.

### Screen reader shell integration support on Windows

Shell integration was previously disabled when a screen reader was detected on Windows due to problems with Powershell support in this context. We have determined that this is no longer an issue in most cases, so have enabled it.


### Terminal accessible help additions

Discussions with the screen reader community have yielded additions to the terminal accessible help menu.

## Workbench

### Moveable Explorer view

The Explorer view (`kb(workbench.view.explorer)`), like many other views in VS Code, can now be moved into the secondary side bar or the bottom panel to allow for further workbench customization.

### Fixed-width centered layout

The centered layout (`kb(workbench.action.toggleCenteredLayout)`) now has a fixed-width layout option. This option enabled with the new `workbench.editor.centeredLayoutFixedWidth` setting. When enabled and centered layout is active, the editor will be centered and attempt to maintain its width across window and panel resizes.

### Multiple quick diffs

With the introduction of the proposed [multiple quick diff API](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/blob/main/release-notes/v1_75.md#quick-diff), multiple extensions can provide a quick diff. When there are multiple quick diffs in a file, you'll now see a dropdown to choose which diff base to view:

![Multiple quick diffs](./images/1_76/multiple-quick-diff.png)

### Comments

The "Comments" view has a new "Expand All" action to go with the existing "Collapse All". The gutter icon for unresolved comments is now the same icon that is used in the "Comments" view.

## Editor

### JSONC document sorting

It is now possible to sort JSONC (JSON documents with comments) files by key. To use this feature, select **JSON: Sort document** from the Command Palette.

## Notebooks

### Notebook renderer performance diagnostics

When running notebook cells, some notebook output renderers may take a long time to render. To help identify these renderers, we've added some diagnostics to the hover in the notebook cell status bar. This view will show the time it took to for each renderer to execute and the execution time. Additionally, the links in the hover will open the issue reporter with the renderer's name and execution time pre-filled so that you can easily file an issue if you find the renderer is taking too long to execute.

![image showing the cell status bar hover with renderer execution times](./images/1_76/notebook-renderer-performance-diagnostics.png)

## Languages

### Git

We've adopted a new git grammar, which provides syntax highlighting for git commit message files. The new grammar has better support for languages other than English.

## Remote Development

The [Remote Development extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack), allow you to use a container, remote machine, or the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl) (WSL) as a full-featured development environment.

You can learn about new extension features and bug fixes in the [Remote Development release notes](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/blob/main/remote-release-notes/v1_76.md).

### Remote indicator

This milestone we made several usability improvements to the remote indicator (visible in the lower left of the Status bar):

1. There is now a default keybinding to open the remote indicator menu: `kb(workbench.action.remote.showMenu)`.

    Sorry, your browser doesn't support HTML 5 video.
   </video>

2. We reduced our remote extensions' contributions to the remote indicator to make it easy to view all actions for connecting to a remote window at a glance.
   * Basic actions for opening a remote window are now always available in the remote indicator, so you can discover actions to connect to another remote even when you are already in a remote window.
   * Most actions for configuring or getting started with a remote have moved from the remote indicator menu to the command palette to conserve space in the remote indicator.

3. The **Install Additional Remote Extensions** option in the remote indicator now points to a list of curated Remote Development extensions and is hidden from the remote indicator menu if all such extensions are already installed.

## VS Code for the Web

This milestone we have added experimental readonly support for [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com/)-tracked files hosted in GitHub and Azure Repos repositories on [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev).

   <video src="images/1_76/web-git-lfs.mp4" placeholder="images/1_76/web-git-lfs.mp4" autoplay loop controls muted title="Viewing a markdown preview of a file containing Git LFS image references in vscode.dev">
    Sorry, your browser doesn't support HTML 5 video.
   </video>

When you view a file in a GitHub or Azure Repos repository, based on your `.gitattributes` configuration, we detect whether the file is LFS-tracked and needs to be fetched from GitHub's or Azure Repos's LFS servers.

You can also use the [GitHub Repositories](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.remotehub) and [Azure Repos](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.azure-repos) extensions with VS Code Desktop to browse repositories containing Git LFS-tracked files without cloning.

This behavior can be disabled with the following settings:

* `"githubRepositories.experimental.lfs.read.enabled": false`
* `"azureRepos.experimental.lfs.read.enabled": false`

Note that we do not yet support committing Git LFS-tracked files, and [github.dev](https://github.dev) does not yet have Git LFS read support.

## Contributions to extensions

### Jupyter

#### IPyWidgets

Version `8` of [IPyWidgets](https://pypi.org/project/ipywidgets/#description) is now supported. Python Widgets relying on `IPyWidgets 7.*` will continue work, as both versions `7.*` and `8.*` are supported.

#### Interactive Window Kernel Selection

Auto-selecting a kernel for the Interactive Window was modified to work better with the new kernel picker UI. The current active interpreter will be used unless another kernel was previously chosen for an Interactive Window in that workspace, in which case the previously selected kernel will be used.

### GitHub Pull Requests and Issues

There has been more progress on the [GitHub Pull Requests and Issues](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github) extension, which allows you to work on, create, and manage pull requests and issues. Highlights include:

* Permalink rendering in the PR description and in comments.
* Re-requesting reviews from the description page.
* Quick diffs for files in a checked-out PR.

Check out the [changelog for the 0.60.0](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-pull-request-github/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#0600) release of the extension to see the other highlights.

## Preview features

### Rich Content Notebook Search

Global search now supports showing results from notebooks as they would be displayed in the notebook editor. Enable `search.experimental.notebookSearch` to try this out, and let us know about any bugs that you run into! This currently only supports searching cell inputs and Markdown sources in cells.

## Proposed APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always, we want your feedback. Here are the steps to try out a proposed API:

1. [Find a proposal that you want to try](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/tree/main/src/vscode-dts) and add its name to `package.json#enabledApiProposals`.
1. Use the latest [vscode-dts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vscode-dts) and run `vscode-dts dev`. It will download the corresponding `d.ts` files into your workspace.
1. You can now program against the proposal.

You cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. There may be breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.

### OpenDialogOptions allowUIResources

Extensions that are aware that they are running in a remote extension host can use `allowUIResources` to cause the "Show local" button to display in open file dialogs. Extensions that use `allowUIResources` should always check the scheme of the URI that's returned.

## Notable fixes

* [168939](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/168939) Persist state of badge hiding across reloads and view moves.
* [164397](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/164397) Layout control in the wrong place for RTL macOS.

## Thank you

Last but certainly not least, a big _**Thank You**_ to the contributors of VS Code.
