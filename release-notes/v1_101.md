## Chat

### User action required sound

We’ve added an accessibility signal to indicate when chat requires user action. This is opt-in as we fine tune the sound. You can configure this behavior with `setting(accessibility.signals.chatUserActionRequired)`.

### Task diagnostic awareness

When the chat agent runs a task, it is now aware of any errors or warnings identified by problem matchers. This diagnostic context allows the agent to respond more intelligently to issues as they arise.

### Terminal cwd context

When a Copilot terminal is open and shell integration is active, the chat agent is aware of the current working directory (cwd), enabling more accurate and context-aware command support.

### Keyword suggestions in core (Preview)

**Setting**: `setting(search.searchView.keywordSuggestions)`

We have migrated the setting previously in the chat extension as `github.copilot.chat.search.keywordSuggestions` to VS Code core as `search.searchView.keywordSuggestions`.
We have also significantly improved the performance of the suggestions, so you will be able to see the results ~5x faster than before.

### Semantic search behavior options (Preview)

**Setting**: `setting(search.searchView.semanticSearchBehavior)`

By default, Semantic Search is only run when you explicitly request it, but no we have added a setting for you to control the behavior you wish to have.

- manual: this is the default and will only request semantic search when you request it manually through the button or keybinding `(Cmd + I)`
- runOnEmpty: this will make semantic search to execute whenever you do a search and did not find any text results
- auto: this will run semantic search alongside text search every time you do a search in the search view

## Accessibility

### New code action sounds

We’ve introduced distinct sounds for when a code action is triggered (`setting(accessibility.signals.codeActionTriggered)`) and when it is applied (`setting(accessibility.signals.codeActionApplied)`).

### Agent mode improvements

We now include rich information about confirmation dialogs in the accessible view - covering past tool runs, the current tool run, and any pending confirmations. This includes the inputs that will be used.

When a confirmation dialog appears in a response, the action’s title is now included in the ARIA label of the corresponding code block, the response’s ARIA label, and the live alert to provide better context for screen reader users.

## Editor Experience

### Find as you type setting

**Setting**: `setting(editor.find.findOnType:true)`

Find-as-you-type has been the default behavior of the Find control, but now you can control whether to keep it that way or disable it so that it will only perform the search after hitting enter.

## Code Editing

## Notebooks

## Source Control

## Terminal

### Gracefully shutdown terminal and task processes

**Setting**: `setting(terminal.integrated.killGracefully)`

We’ve added an opt-in setting, `setting(terminal.integrated.killGracefully)`, to cleanly shut down terminal processes, including child processes. This helps avoid orphaned processes, frees up ports, and can reduce the risk of resource leaks.

## Tasks

### Instance policy

Task `runOptions` now has an `instancePolicy` property, which determines what happens when a task has reached its `instanceLimit`.

Options include `prompt` (default), `silent`, `terminateNewest`, `terminateOldest`, and `warn`.

![instancePolicy is being configured in a tasks.json file and displays the options with prompt as the default value](images/1_101/instancePolicy.png)

```

## Debugging

## Languages

## Remote Development

## Extension Authoring

### Web Environment detection
⚠️ Breaking change ⚠️

**Setting**: `setting(extensions.supportNodeGlobalNavigator)`

The Node.js extension host is now updated to v22 from v20, as part of our [Electron 35 runtime update](#electron-35-update). This update brings in support for the [`navigator` global object](https://github.com/nodejs/node/commit/b40f0c30743aaecd57071f7be305df43e1083817) in the desktop and remote extension hosts.

This change could introduce a breaking change for extensions that rely on the presence of the `navigator` object to detect the web environment.

To help extension authors migrate, we have created a polyfill for `globalThis.navigator` that is initialized to `undefined`, so your extension continues to work correctly. The polyfill is behind the `setting(extensions.supportNodeGlobalNavigator)` VS Code setting. By default, this setting is disabled and the polyfill is in place. We capture telemetry and log an error (in extension development mode) when your extension tries to access the `navigator` in this way.

In the future, this setting might be enabled by default, so we urge extension authors to migrate their code to be compatible with the new `navigator` global object. Follow these steps to migrate your code:

* Check the extension host log for a `PendingMigrationError` that has error stack originating your extension.
* Ensure checks like `typeof navigator === 'object'` are migrated to `typeof process === 'object' && process.versions.node` as needed.
* Enable `setting(extensions.supportNodeGlobalNavigator)`.
* Verify extension behavior remains unchanged.

## Engineering

### Electron 35 update

In this milestone, we are promoting the Electron 35 update to users on our stable release. This update comes with Chromium 134.0.6998.205 and Node.js 22.15.1. We want to thank everyone who self-hosted on Insiders builds and provided early feedback.

## Thank you

Last but certainly not least, a big _**Thank You**_ to the contributors of VS Code.
