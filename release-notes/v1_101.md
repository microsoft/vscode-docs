Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the May 1.101 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the May milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/main)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A%22May+2025%22)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.
