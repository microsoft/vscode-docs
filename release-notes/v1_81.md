Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the July 1.81 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the July milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/main)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.

We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.
