## Insiders Release

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the June 1.25 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll see details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the June release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[June Iteration Plan](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/51483)** - See what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit Log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/69?closed=1)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the June milestone.

We really appreciate people taking a look at our new features as soon as they are ready so check back here often and learn what's new to try out.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the VS Code repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues).

## Workbench

### Grid Editor Layout

You can now arrange editors both vertically and horizontally and have more than 3 editors side by side:

![Grid Editor Layout](images/1_25/grid-layout.gif)

To support flexible layouts, you can create empty editor groups. By default, closing the last editor of an editor group will also close the group itself, but you can change this behavior with the new setting `workbench.editor.closeEmptyGroups: false`.

![Grid Empty](images/1_25/grid-empty.png)

There are a predefined set of editor layouts in the new **View** > **Editor Layout** menu:

![Grid Editor Layout Menu](images/1_25/grid-layout-menu.png)

Editors that open to the side (for example by clicking the editor toolbar **Split Editor** action) will by default open to the right hand side of the active editor. If you prefer to open editors below the active one, configure the new setting `workbench.editor.openSideBySideDirection: down`.

There are many [new commands](#new-commands) for adjusting the editor layout with the keyboard alone, but if you prefer to use the mouse, drag and drop is a fast way to split the editor into any direction:

![Grid Editor Drag and Drop](images/1_25/grid-dnd.gif)

Since editor groups are now unlimited and can be arranged in many ways, the **OPEN EDITORS** view no longer labels editor groups as **Left**, **Center**, or **Right**. Instead, editor groups are now labeled with numbers according to their creation time. Thus, the last editor group created will always be at the end of the **OPEN EDITORS** list. We found this to be a good model that minimizes changing the list when moving editor groups around in the layout:

![Grid Open Editors View](images/1_25/grid-open-editors.png)

Refer to the [Extension Authoring](#extension-authoring) section for the impact on extensions and themes and see [New Commands](#new-commands) for the list of new editor grid commands.

>**Pro Tip**: If you press and hold the `Alt` key while hovering over the toolbar action to split an editor, it will offer to split to the other orientation. This is a fast way to split either to the right or to the bottom.

![Grid Alt Click](images/1_25/grid-alt.gif)

### Outline view

The Outline view is out of preview and now enabled by default. It is a separate section in the bottom of the File Explorer. When expanded, it will show the symbol tree of the currently active editor.

The Outline view has different 'Sort By' modes, optional cursor tracking, and supports the usual open gestures. It also includes an input box which finds or filters symbols as you type. Errors and warnings are also shown in the Outline view letting you see at a glance where the trouble is.

![Outline](images/1_25/outline.png)

There are several Outline view settings which allow you to enable/disable icons and control the errors and warnings display.

There is also a [new API](#document-symbols) for extensions authors.

### Language Packs

VS Code now ships with only English as the display language and other [languages](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/locales#_available-locales) now rely on Language Packs installable from the VS Code [Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?target=VSCode&category=Language%20Packs&sortBy=Downloads). You should not notice this change if you had installed a Language Pack when prompted by the 1.23 or 1.24 versions of VS Code. If you are upgrading from an older version of VS Code or have a fresh installation, you will see a prompt to install the Language Pack of your OS's UI language. Additional Language Packs can be installed from the Marketplace using the Extensions view (`kb(workbench.view.extensions)`).

To summarize:

* If you update from VS Code version 1.22 or older to 1.25, the display language will be English and VS Code will prompt you to install the Language Pack for the OS's UI language, if such a Language Pack is available in the Marketplace.
* If you update from 1.23 or 1.24 to 1.25, you should already have been prompted to install the Language Pack for the UI language. If you did so, 1.25 will start as normal and the display language is presented as the chosen UI language. If you didn't install a Language Pack, then you will be prompted to do so.
* Fresh installs of VS Code, version 1.25 or higher, will prompt you to install a Language Pack if an appropriate one is available in the Marketplace.

### Drop files and folders into empty files explorer

Now it is possible to drop files, folders and  VS Code workspace files into an empty Explorer to open them.

![empty drop](images/1_25/drop.gif)

### History Navigation

Navigating input history is now more natural and consistent across VS Code. You can use the <kbd>UpArrow</kbd> (`history.showPrevious`) and <kbd>DownArrow</kbd> (`history.showNext`) keys to navigate the input boxes in the Search and Problems views and the Find widgets in the Editor, Terminal, and Web views.

For simplicity and consistency, we changed the default keybindings for navigating among input boxes from <kbd>UpArrow</kbd> and <kbd>DownArrow</kbd> to <kbd>Ctrl+UpArrow</kbd> (or <kbd>Cmd+UpArrow</kbd> on macOS) and <kbd>Ctrl+DownArrow</kbd> (or <kbd>Cmd+DownArrow</kbd> on macOS) keys respectively. You can always go back to previous behavior by updating `kb(search.focus.previousInputBox)`, `kb(search.focus.nextInputBox)` and `kb(search.action.focusSearchFromResults)` keybindings.

**Note**: We also removed all existing [18 History Navigation Commands](#history-navigation-commands) and unified them into two commands `history.showPrevious` and `history.showNext`.

## Editor

### Suggestion selections

Language IntelliSense providers often know what suggestions are best and with this version of VS Code, they can now preselect suggestions. There is new [API](#preselected-completion-items) for preselected suggestions and when available, the editor will select not the first but the preselected suggestion.

![suggestion selection](images/1_25/suggest_preselect.png)

### Snippet placeholder transformations

Snippets finally support placeholder transformations. Placeholder transformations are like variable transformations but more dynamic. A transformation is applied when switching from one placeholder to the next and this is the grammar rule for them: __${__*int*__/__*regex*__/__*format_string*__/__*opts*__}__.

Below is a sample that replaces "Hello World" with its German counterpart:

```json
"HelloWorld": {
  "prefix": "say_hello",
  "body": "${1} ${2} -> ${1/Hello/Hallo/} ${2/World/Welt/}"
}
```

![placeholder transformation](images/1_25/snippet_placeholder_transform.gif)

Refer to the [snippet grammar](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets#_grammar) for more details and how to unleash the full potential of transformations.

## Integrated Terminal

### New parser

The Integrated Terminal's parser was re-written from the ground up for enhanced ANSI compliance and boosting the rate at which incoming data is processed by approximately 30%. This came in as an upstream community contribution to [xterm.js](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/1399).

### Experimental: Dynamic texture atlas

An experimental setting has been added to enable the new "dynamic texture atlas" for the [terminal canvas](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2017/10/03/terminal-renderer). This changes the caching strategy used by the terminal to store character glyphs. Instead of being a fixed set of glyphs on the default background, glyphs are now added to the texture atlas as they are required and regardless of the background being used. This should reduce the first terminal start up time, reduce rendering time of characters not using the default background, as well as improving overall rendering performance.

This will eventually be the default, for now you can opt-in with the following setting:

```json
{
  "terminal.integrated.experimentalTextureCachingStrategy": "dynamic"
}
```

This came in as an upstream community contribution to [xterm.js](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/1327).

### Bold text bright color setting

The terminal currently converts all bold text to use the bright color variant. This is a little inconsistent across terminal emulators and is mostly around for legacy reasons. You can now turn this automatic conversion off to allow the use of non-bright colors for bold text.

```json
{
  "terminal.integrated.drawBoldTextInBrightColors": false
}
```

This came in as an upstream community contribution to [xterm.js](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/1391).

## Debugging

### "Unchained" floating debug toolbar

In the previous milestone, we have introduced a new setting to dock the debug toolbar in the Debug view (`"debug.toolBarLocation": "docked"`). In this milestone, we reviewed user feedback and tried to improve the floating toolbar behavior as well (`"debug.toolBarLocation": "floating"`).

The [consensus](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/52490) from the feedback was that the toolbar should always be visible (independent from which view is active) and that it should not hide anything (for instance the editor tabs). Therefore we've "unchained" the floating toolbar by allowing it to be dragged to the editor area. This should help users that heavily use editor tabs but also want to see the debug toolbar at all times.

![debug toolbar](images/1_25/debugtoolbar.gif)

Since the existing `debug.hideActionBar` setting can be easily subsumed under a value `hidden` with the `debug.toolBarLocation` setting, we are now **removing** `debug.hideActionBar`.

### Breakpoint state tracks debug session

In VS Code, breakpoints are shared between all debuggers and every debugger can decide whether to honor a breakpoint or adjust the breakpoint position, for example, move it to a different line. This results in dynamic state that is associated with a breakpoint for the duration of a debug session. With parallel debug sessions, there can even be multiple states per breakpoint. Previously, VS Code had merged the different states, which sometimes resulted in a confusing experience. With this release, the breakpoint UI now properly reflects only the state of the active debug session. Focusing on a different debug session properly updates the breakpoint state.

## Preview Features

Preview features are not ready for release but are functional enough to use. We welcome your early feedback while they are under development.

## Extension Authoring

### Grid Editor Layout: ViewColumn

There are only a few API adjustments to support the new editor grid layout feature. Most notably, there is a new `ViewColumn.Beside` action that can be used to open an editor to the side of the active one. With the grid editor layout, there is no longer a limit in the number of opened editors, so using that option will always create a new editor to the side of the active one unless there is already some space to the side. Depending on the user setting `workbench.editor.openSideBySideDirection`, this can either be to the right or below the editor.

The `ViewColumn` value for text editors and webviews still goes by the order of appearance in the editor area from left to right as shown below:

![Grid Editor Numbering](images/1_25/grid-numbering.png)

Even though the `ViewColumn` enumeration was extended all the way to `ViewColumn.Nine`, a `TextEditor` will always have a number assigned as view column as long as it is contained in the grid.

When an editor group is moved or an editor group is closed, the `onDidChangeTextEditorViewColumn` event is fired as before.

### Grid Editor Layout: New Commands

Even though the change to the API is minimal to support the new grid editor layout, extensions can still make use of the grid editor layout by leveraging new commands that were added (see the [New Commands](#new-commands) section for a complete overview).

The new `vscode.setEditorLayout` deserves a bit of explanation as it allows you to change the overall editor layout with a single command and arguments. The layout is described as object with an initial (optional) orientation (`0` = horizontal, `1` = vertical) and an array of editor `groups` within. Each editor group can have a `size` and another array of editor `groups` that will be laid out orthogonal to the orientation. If editor group sizes are provided, their sum must be `1` to be applied per row or column.

Example for a 2x2 grid:

```json
{ orientation: 0, groups: [{ groups: [{}, {}], size: 0.5 }, { groups: [{}, {}], size: 0.5 }] }
```

### Editors open in active ViewColumn by default

If no `ViewColumn` is provided when opening a text editor or webview , VS Code now defaults to opening in the currently active editor group, instead of opening it in `ViewColumn.One`. If you want to preserve the previous behavior, just pass in `ViewColumn.One` when opening.

### Preselected Completion Items

Extension that provide completion items can now marks them as 'preselected'. That is useful when many completions exist but when some are most likely to be selected. A sample for this is assigning known variable types but this also enables extensions to favor more commonly used completions, like favor `console.log` over `console.dirxml`.

The API additional is just `'CompletionItem#preselect: boolean'` and when many preselected items exists the one with the highest rank is selected.

### Document Symbols

To get the most out of the new outline tree extensions should adopt their `DocumentSymbolProviders` to return `DocumentSymbols`. That is a new type we have added and it is tailored towards the needs of the outline tree. It supports to represent a hierarchy of document symbols and it allows to differentiate between the range that defines a symbol and the range the identifies a symbol.

```bash

         +--/**
         |   * Some Comment
<range>--|   */
         |  export function fooFunction() {
         |                  +----------+
         +--}                   |
                                |
                          <selection range>
```

### Readonly file system provider

A file system provider can now be registered as `readonly`. VS Code will respect this flag by disabling all the mutating commands on the resources coming from that file system provider. Editors will also be opened in readonly mode for those readonly resources.

### Custom views

**Tree view visibility**

You can now check if the tree view is visible or not using the following newly added property and event to `TreeView`

```typescript
/**
 * `true` if the [tree view](#TreeView) is visible otherwise `false`.
 */
readonly visible: boolean;

/**
 * Event that is fired when [visibility](TreeView.visible) has changed
 */
readonly onDidChangeVisibility: Event<TreeViewVisibilityChangeEvent>;

/**
 * The event that is fired when there is a change in [tree view's visibility](#TreeView.visible)
 */
export interface TreeViewVisibilityChangeEvent {

  /**
   * `true` if the [tree view](#TreeView) is visible otherwise `false`.
   */
  readonly visible: boolean;

}

```

**Selection Listener**

A new selection change event is added to the tree view to listen to the selection changes

```typescript
/**
 * Event that is fired when the [selection](#TreeView.selection) has changed
 */
readonly onDidChangeSelection: Event<TreeViewSelectionChangeEvent<T>>;

/**
 * The event that is fired when there is a change in [tree view's selection](#TreeView.selection)
 */
export interface TreeViewSelectionChangeEvent<T> {

  /**
   * Selected elements.
  */
  readonly selection: T[];

}

```

**Reveal and Focus**

You can now reveal and focus an element in the tree view by setting the focus option to `true` while calling the `reveal` API

```typescript
reveal(element: T, options?: { select?: boolean, focus?: boolean }): Thenable<void>;
```

### New Theme colors

There are two new theme colors for the background color of empty editor groups, a feature that came out of the work to support editor grid layout:

* `editorGroup.emptyBackground`: Background color of an empty editor group.
* `editorGroup.focusedEmptyBorder`: Border color of an empty editor group that is focused.

![Grid Editor Group Background](images/1_25/grid-background.png)

* `editorPane.background`: Background color of the editor pane visible on the left and right side of the centered editor layout

![Editor Pane Background](images/1_25/editorPaneBackground.png)

### Deprecated Theme colors

The theme color `editorGroup.background` is no longer supported with the introduction of the grid editor layout feature.

### Rename Command

The rename-command (`editor.action.rename`) can now be invoked with an `Uri` and a `Position` and the editor will initiate a rename operation accordingly. Like so:

```ts
vscode.commands.executeCommand(
  'editor.action.rename',
  [vscode.Uri.file('/my/file.abc'), new vscode.Position(14, 7)]
)
```

## Proposed Extension APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always we are keen on your feedback. This is what you have to do to try out proposed API:

* You must use Insiders because proposed API changes frequently.
* You must have this line in the package.json-file of your extension: `"enableProposedAPI": true`.
* Copy the latest version of the [`vscode.proposed.d.ts`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/vscode.proposed.d.ts) file into your project.
* Play around with proposed API, provide feedback, shape the API.

Note that you cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. We may likely make breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break extensions.

### WorkspaceEdit can create/rename/delete Files

We have added proposed API that extends the `WorkspaceEdit` so that it can be used to create, rename, and delete files or folders. This is useful for complex refactorings, e.g renaming a file when a type is being renamed but should also enable other scenarios.

### Local Rename Events

We are proposing two events that fire before and after a rename occurs. They are called `onWillRenameFile` and `onDidRenameFile` and they allow react or participate in the rename.

### QuickInput API

The additional `QuickPick` and `InputBox` APIs allow for more flexible collection of user input than the existing `showQuickPick` and `showInputBox` APIs. With the new API you create a new instance of an input object on which you then register event handlers and set properties according to your use case:

```ts
export namespace window {
  export function createQuickPick<T extends QuickPickItem>(): QuickPick<T>;
  export function createInputBox(): InputBox;
}
```

There are samples of the QuickInput API's usage in a [sample extension](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-extension-samples/tree/master/quickinput-sample). The multi-step input sample:

![Multi-step input sample](images/1_25/multistepinput.gif)

If the existing `showQuickPick` and `showInputBox` APIs are not flexible enough, use the new `QuickPick` and `InputBox` APIs, otherwise keep to the existing ones as these will get the job done quicker.

Use issue [#53327](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/53327) for feedback and discussion.

### Terminal renderers

The concept of a terminal "renderer" is being proposed. A terminal renderer is basically a terminal instance within the terminal panel but it has no backing process, instead the *extension* acts as the process. This is useful for implementing a terminal multi-plexer within VS Code where the extension has access to the in/out pipes of some process, which are hooked then up to the terminal renderer. The [Live Share extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare) is planning on using this new API to improve the stability and maintainability of its shared terminal support.

```ts
export namespace window {
  export function createTerminalRenderer(name: string): TerminalRenderer;
}

export interface TerminalRenderer {
  name: string;
  dimensions: TerminalDimensions | undefined;
  readonly maximumDimensions: TerminalDimensions | undefined;
  readonly terminal: Terminal;
  readonly onDidAcceptInput: Event<string>;
  readonly onDidChangeMaximumDimensions: Event<TerminalDimensions>;
  write(text: string): void;
}

export interface TerminalDimensions {
  readonly columns: number;
  readonly rows: number;
}
```

Another example use case is an extension creating its own REPL, this works by the extension listening to every character press and acting when the enter key is pressed:

```ts
const shell = vscode.window.createTerminalRenderer('My Extension REPL');
shell.write('Type and press enter to echo the text\r\n\r\n');
shell.terminal.show();

let line = '';
shell.onDidAcceptInput(data => {
  if (data === '\r') {
    shell.write(`\r\necho: "${line}"\r\n\n`);
    line = '';
  } else {
    line += data;
    shell.write(data);
  }
});
```

### Tracking the active terminal

We are proposing new extension APIs for the terminal that make it possible to track what the active terminal is, similar to `window.activeTextEditor` and `window.onDidChangeActiveTextEditor`:

```ts
export namespace
  export const activeTerminal: Terminal | undefined;
  export const onDidChangeActiveTerminal: Event<Terminal | undefined>;
}
```

### Terminal.onData renamed

Terminal.onData has been renamed to onDidWriteData in order to align with our [naming guidelines](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/wiki/Extension-API-guidelines#event-naming):

```ts
export interface Terminal {
  onDidWriteData: Event<string>;
}
```

### New `layoutEditorGroups` command

The `layoutEditorGroups` command lets you set an editor group layout the way you like and assign it a keybinding. The layout is described as object with an initial (optional) orientation (`0` = horizontal, `1` = vertical) and an array of editor `groups` within. Each editor group can have a `size` and another array of editor `groups` that will be laid out orthogonal to the orientation. If editor group sizes are provided, their sum must be `1` to be applied per row or column. For example:

```json
{
    "key": "Ctrl+0",
    "command": "layoutEditorGroups",
    "args": {
        "orientation": 1,
        "groups": [{ "size": 0.2 }, { "size": 0.6 }, { "size": 0.2, "groups": [{}, {}] }]
    }
}
```

This will produce the following layout:
