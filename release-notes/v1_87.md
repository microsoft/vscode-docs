## Accessibility

### Voice: Editor Dictation

You can now use your voice to dictate directly into the text editor provided that you have installed the [VS Code Speech](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-speech) extension.

<video src="images/1_87/editor-dictate.mp4" autoplay loop controls muted title="Dictate to the editor using voice."></video>

New commands have been added to start and stop editor dictation (**Voice: Start Dictation in Editor** (`kb(workbench.action.editorDictation.start)`), **Voice: Stop Dictation in Editor** (`kb(workbench.action.editorDictation.stop)`)).

You can press and hold the keybinding for the start command (`kb(workbench.action.editorDictation.start)`) to enable walky-talky mode where the voice recognition will stop when you release the keys.

**Note:** this even works in other places where a rich editor is used, such as the SCM commit input box and the comments input field when reviewing Pull Requests.

### Voice: Languages Support

When you use the [VS Code Speech](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-speech) extension, there is now a new setting <code codesetting="accessibility.voice.speechLanguage">accessibility.voice.speechLanguage</code> to select from one of 26 languages to recognize speech from.

<video src="images/1_87/voice-language.mp4" autoplay loop controls muted title="Speech languages support via settings."></video>

Languages for the speech extension come as their own extension, so you will see an extension installation for each language you picked as soon as you start recording for the first time.

### Accessibility Signals

Accessibility signals encompass sounds, formerly called audio cues, and announcements,formerly called alerts.

The commands `Help: List Signal Sounds` and `Help: List Signal Announcements` allow users to view available signals and configure them. Migration to this new configuration happens automatically.

Before:

```
"audioCues.clear": "on | auto | off"
"accessibility.alert.clear": true | false
```

After:

```
"accessibility.signals.clear": {
    "sound": "auto | on | off",
    "announcement" (optional): "auto | off"
}
```

## Workbench

### Transparency and control of language model access

This iteration, we have introduced a proposed API that gives extensions the ability to leverage GitHub Copilot Chat's language models. In order to provide the most transparency and control of access to the models, we have added the following:

#### Manage language model access like you manage authentication access

We found that managing access to language models was very similar to managing access to your GitHub account or Microsoft account (or anything that leverages the `AuthenticationProvider` model) in VS Code. Because of these similarities, we've leveraged VS Code's auth stack for access to langauge models as well.

When an extension wan't to access the language models of another extension, they'll see a one-time prompt for access that will be persisted:
![modal showing language model access](images/1_87/auth-language-model.png)

Once access is granted, you'll be able to manage that access in the same place you manage access to your accounts, in the account menu:

![account menu](images/1_87/auth-account-menu.png)

"Manage Trusted Extensions" leading you to a quick pick where you can manage access if you so choose:

![manage trusted extensions quick pick](images/1_87/manage-trusted-extensions.png)

With the initial work done, we'll continue to refine the experience so it's as smooth and clear as possible.

## Source Control

### Repository/Branch name in the window title

Users can customize the window title using the <code codesetting="window.title">window.title</code> setting. This milestone we have added two new variables that can be used with this setting: `${activeRepositoryName}`, and `${activeRepositoryBranchName}`. When used, these variables will be replaced with the name of the active repository and the name of the active branch, respectively.

### Commit input validation improvements

This milestone we have explored using language diagnostics to provide better input validation when authoring commit messages. Using language diagnostics enables us to surface code actions that can be invoked to resolve the input validation warnings. We have added code actions to remove whitespace characters, hard wrap lines based on the <code codesetting="git.inputValidationSubjectLength">git.inputValidationSubjectLength</code>, and <code codesetting="git.inputValidationLength">git.inputValidationLength</code> settings, and we are looking to add more code actions in the future.

To enable it, toggle the <code codesetting="git.inputValidation:true">git.inputValidation</code> setting. We have some issues to work through before we can enable this by default, but in the meantime please feel free to enable it and let us know your feedback.

### Incoming/Outgoing changes settings management

We continue to polish the "Incoming/Outgoing" section of the Source Control view. This milestone we have added a settings action to the "Incoming/Outgoing" separator that allows users to toggle the <code codesetting="scm.showIncomingChanges">scm.showIncomingChanges</code>, <code codesetting="scm.showOutgoingChanges">scm.showOutgoingChanges</code>, <code codesetting="scm.showChangesSummary">scm.showChangesSummary</code> settings more easily. The same actions are also available in the "Incoming & Outgoing" menu in the `...` menu of the Source Control view's title bar.

### Close All Unmodified Editors command

To help with editor management, this milestone we have added a new command to the command palette, **Close All Unmodified Editors**, that will close all editors that have unmodified files. The command will not close editors that have unsaved changes.

### GitHub Copilot

#### Inline Chat Accessibility View

Inline chat now has an accessibility view that shows code changes just like the accessible diff viewer does. It is enabled when using screen reader mode but can also be configured to be always on or off, use the <code codesetting="inlineChat.accessibleDiffView">inlineChat.accessibleDiffView</code>-setting for that.

Also, change-hunks can now be navigated with the keyboard via `kbstyle(F7)` and `kbstyle(Shift+F7)`.

#### Inline Chat Default Mode

We have retired the live preview mode and made `live` the default mode for inline chat.

#### Voice: Always Visible Microphone Icon

The microphone icon to start voice recognition for input to the chat fields is now always visible, even when [VS Code Speech](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-speech) is not yet installed. Clicking the icon will ask to install the extension to enable speech-to-text capabilities.

![Microphone icon in chat input](images/1_87/chat-mic.png)

If you are not interested in this feature or want to only use it via keyboard shortcuts, you can easily hide the action from the right click menu:

![Hide microphone icon in chat input](images/1_87/chat-mic-hide.png)

#### Voice: Support for Agents and Slash Commands

When using the [VS Code Speech](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-speech) extension to fill the chat input field via voice, phrases such as "at workspace" or "slash fix" will now translate into respective agent and slash commands.

<video src="images/1_87/voice-agent.mp4" autoplay loop controls muted title="Agent and slash commands support in Voice."></video>

This works in the chat view as well as inline chat.

#### Voice: Walky-talky mode everywhere

When using the [VS Code Speech](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-speech) extension, the command **Voice: Start Voice Chat** (`kb(workbench.action.chat.startVoiceChat)`) now works everywhere and will bring up a voice chat depending on where your focus is (inline chat in the editor, panel chat otherwise).

Press and hold the keybinding to enable walky-talky mode: voice recognition will run until you release the keys and then submit automatically.

#### `Copilot: Explain This` based on cursor position

Previously, `Explain This` required that you selected the text to explain in your active editor. You can now also place your cursor on an identifier to get Copilot to see the identifier's definition. If the definition is in another file, this requires rich language support to be available.

#### Preview: `#codebase` variable

This iteration, in the **pre-release** version of GitHub Copilot Chat, we've introduced a new chat varible called `#codebase`. This variable can be used to provide workspace context, based on your query, to Copilot or a chat participant (aka agent) you are talking to.

<video src="images/1_87/codebase.mp4" title="#codebase variable" autoplay loop controls muted></video>

In this example, you can kind of think of `#codebase` as asking `@workspace` the question first, and then adding that response to the question you're asking `@terminal`.

This is a preview feature so `#codebase` may not be the final name of this varible but the intent is that we will provide some way to include workspace context to chat participants (aka agents).

Again, this is only in the pre-release version of GitHub Copilot Chat. Let us know what you think and how you use it!

### Python

#### Shell integration for the Python REPL
We now have shell integration for Python REPL enabled, Mac, Linux and Windows when using the [WSL extension](
https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl
). When executing commands in the Python REPL, colored circles decorators will indicate whether the commands succeeded or failed. Additionally, we also support **Terminal: Run Recent Command…** command for Python REPL, allowing you to view and utilize the REPL’s command history.
We also now support Python’s shell file history for all operating systems accessible via **Terminal: Run Recent Command**

#### Reducing Risk of Ignored First Command
Reducing Risk of Ignored First Command:
Previously, a number of Python REPL users, especially those on Windows or working on older machines, noticed that their first Python command sent to REPL (e.g. by Shift+Enter), was ignored completely and not sent to Python REPL, or pasted multiple times in their shell that launches Python REPL instead of inside Python REPL. In this iteration, we made efforts to mitigate and reduce the risk of this happening. Users will now experience less occurrence of their first command being lost when they send their Python command to the first REPL instance inside VS Code.

#### New Add Imports Code Action Heuristics Setting
When using the pre-release version of Pylance, the **Add Import** quick fix when there are missing imports has been improved. Pylance now uses heuristics to show only the top 3 high-confidence import options, prioritized based on the following criteria: most recently used imports, symbols from the same module, symbols from the standard library, symbols from user modules, symbols from third-party packages, and finally sorting by module and symbol name.

Additionally, two new code actions have been introduced: **Search for additional import matches**, which displays a quick pick menu that allows you to search for import options that prefix-match the missing import symbol, and **Change spelling**, which offers import suggestions for missing imports due to typos.

We plan to enable this new behaviour by default soon. However, you can enable it now by setting `python.analysis.addImport.heuristics : "true"` in your settings.

#### Automatically open the browser when debugging Django or Flask apps
Developing and testing your Python web applications is now more convenient with the [Python Debugger extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.debugpy)! You can now get the browser to automatically open when starting the debugger with Django or Flask apps, by setting `autoStartBrowser: true` in your launch.json configuration:
```
{
    "name": "Python Debugger: Flask",
    "type": "debugpy",
    "request": "launch",
    "module": "flask",
    "env": {
        "FLASK_APP": "hello_app.webapp",
        "FLASK_DEBUG": "1"
    },
    "args": [
        "run"
    ],
    "jinja": true,
    "autoStartBrowser": true
}
```

#### Bug Fix for Pytest in Symlinked Workspaces
A bug fix now allows pytest tests to function correctly for workspaces which have symlinks. On the testing rewrite, test from symlink locations will be referenced and run correctly by their symlink paths.

### GitHub Pull Requests and Issues


## Preview Features

### For extension authors: Preview of `@vscode/l10n-dev` and Azure AI Translator

This iteration, we have introduced a new command subcommand of `@vscode/l10n-dev` that allows you to translate your strings using [Azure AI Translator](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/ai-translator).

After exporting your strings, and creating an Azure AI Translator instance, you can set the `AZURE_TRANSLATOR_KEY` & `AZURE_TRANSLATOR_REGION` environment variables and then you can run the following command to generate translations using Azure AI Translator:
```
npx @vscode/l10n-dev generate-azure -o ./l10n/ ./l10n/bundle.l10n.json ./package.nls.json
```

<video src="images/1_87/azure-translator.mp4" title="l10n-dev using Azure Translator" autoplay loop controls muted></video>

Azure AI Translator offer's a free tier. We thought it was a good opportunity to offer tooling to extension authors so that they can support, with ease, the many users who speak a variety of languages. Do keep in mind that these translations are machine translated so they may not always be perfect, but it should be a good jumping off point to more refined translations from people who speak the language if you have the ability to do so.

For more information, take a look at [the l10n-dev documentation on the Azure AI Translator integration](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-l10n/blob/main/l10n-dev/README.md#azure-ai-translator-experimental)

## Proposed APIs

### FindFiles2 API
We have added a new proposed extension API that is an improved version of the existing `workspace.FindFiles` API. The new `workspace.FindFiles2` API introduces new options that allow a workspace file search to:

- Respect `files.exclude` and `search.exclude` settings.
- Respect ignore files.
- Peform a fuzzy search.
- Follow symlinks.

You can review the new API [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/4e2aa982224429f161423cbdded9587e39766782/src/vscode-dts/vscode.proposed.findFiles2.d.ts).

Please note that `FindFiles2` is a tentative name and that this functionality may be provided as an alternative overload of `FindFiles` in the future.
