You can download the nightly [Insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders) build and try the latest updates as soon as they are available. And for the latest Visual Studio Code news, updates, and content, follow us on Twitter [@code](https://twitter.com/code)!

## Updated Visual Studio Code icon

Over the past two months, we've been working on updating the VS Code product logo. [We've taken feedback from the community](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/71827) (thank you to everyone who responded) and we are happy to release the new logos for Stable and Insiders. We are also using same logo on all platforms.

Stable | Insiders
--- | ---
![Stable logo](images/1_35/logo-stable.png) | ![Insiders logo](images/1_35/logo-insiders.png)

**Note**: Depending on your platform, you may still see the earlier logo due to the operating system caching the application icon. If you do encounter caching issues, [follow these steps](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/71827#issuecomment-498352621) to clear your icon cache.

## Editor

### Go to Definition improvements

We have polished the **Go to Definition** action and its friends, **Go to Declaration**, **Go to Type Definition**, and **Go to Implementation**.

* Earlier, we added the `editor.gotoLocation.multiple: goto` option to disable showing a Peek view when a symbol has multiple definitions. However, it would only show the first definition and ignore the rest. This is now much better, as multiple results are shown in the Status bar and pressing `kb(editor.gotoNextSymbolFromResult)` jumps to each definition.

![Go to Definition, no Peek view](images/1_35/go-to-def-loop.gif)

* **Go to Definition** now honors the `workbench.editor.revealIfOpen` setting. This means that an editor that is already open in another group can be reused (or not) when going to a symbol. Note that the old, hard-coded behavior was to reuse the current editor and the default for `revealIfOpen` is not to reuse.
* The Peek view now supports search and filter, like the results tree, to allow you to quickly narrow down on a result.
* Last but not least, you can now cancel long running requests for definitions by pressing `kb(editor.cancelOperation)`.

### Breadcrumbs displayed

Breadcrumbs for quick file and symbol navigation are now on by default. This can be toggled in the View menu **View** > **Toggle Breadcrumbs** command.

![breadcrumb navigation on by default](images/1_35/breadcrumbs.png)

## Languages

### TypeScript 3.5

VS Code now ships with [TypeScript 3.5.1](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-3-5/). This update brings TypeScript language improvements, along with tooling enhancements for both JavaScript and TypeScript. It also fixes a number of important bugs, including fixes for performance issues that some users were seeing when working with styled-components.

### Smart selection for JavaScript and TypeScript

JavaScript and TypeScript now support [smart selection](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_33#_smart-select-api). This feature uses semantic knowledge to intelligently expand selections for expressions, types, statements, classes, and imports:

![Smart selection in a TypeScript file](images/1_35/ts-smart-select.gif)

### Extract to type alias refactoring for TypeScript

Use the new **Extract to type alias**  refactoring for TypeScript to quickly extract part type into its own type alias:

![Extracting part of complex type to a type alias](images/1_35/ts-extract-type.gif)

The **Extract to type alias** refactoring has a kind of `refactor.extract.type`. You can configure a single keybinding that extracts either constants or type aliases using:

```json
{
    "key": "shift+ctrl+e",
    "command": "editor.action.codeAction",
    "args": {
        "kind": "refactor.extract",
        "preferred": true
    }
}
```

See the [Code Action](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/refactoring#_keybindings-for-code-actions) documentation for more information on configuring keybindings for refactorings.

### JavaScript and TypeScript suggestion sorting

We've tuned our suggestion sorting for JavaScript and TypeScript to more heavily prioritize suggestions for local variables over suggestions for globals or auto-imports:

As shown in the image below, if you create a function called `setTimOut`, VS Code will now suggest it first instead of assuming you mean `setTimeout`.

![Suggest user defined setTimOut function first](images/1_35/ts-suggestions.png)

## Integrated Terminal

### True color support

The terminal now supports programs that use true color (24-bit) escape sequences, rendering the correct color instead of the previous approximation of it.

Before:

![Integrated Terminal 256 color approximation](images/1_35/true-color-before.png)

After:

![Integrated Terminal true color](images/1_35/true-color-after.png)

### Improved surfacing of shell selector on Windows

For some time, there has been a command to select the default shell on Windows. This release makes the command more discoverable as a shortcut available in the terminal selector dropdown.

![Integrated Terminal shell selector](images/1_35/shell-selector.png)

## Source control

### Compare merge conflicts with complete context

A new setting `merge-conflict.diffViewPosition` allows you to open the diff view in a new editor group when you compare merge conflicts. In addition, the new view shows the complete diff view of the changed file, which provides better context for the merge conflicts.

![Compare merge conflicts in a new editor group](images/1_35/compare-conflict.gif)

## Contributions to extensions

### Remote Development (Preview)

The [Remote Development](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/download/extension) extensions are now available for VS Code Stable and allow you to use a container, remote machine, or the [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/wsl) as a full-featured development environment. The extensions run in the context of the remote workspace while you work with VS Code just as you would in a local workspace.

![Remote development architecture](images/1_35/remote-architecture.png)

You can learn about new extension features and bug fixes in the [Remote Development release notes](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/tree/master/remote-release-notes/v1_35.md).

## Extension authoring

### Command enablement

Contributed commands can now control their enabled state using a new `enablement` property. Its value is a [when](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings#_when-clause-contexts) clause, similar to keybindings and menu contributions.

The sample below shows how to add a **Hello Enablement** command to the editor's context menu and have its enabled state depend on whether text is selected in an editor.

```json
"commands": [{
    "command": "extension.sayHello",
    "title": "Hello Enablement",
    "enablement": "editorHasSelection"
}],
"menus": {
    "editor/context": [{
        "command": "extension.sayHello",
    }]
}
```

Disabled commands are shown as grayed-out in menus:

![Disabled contributed command](images/1_35/command-enablement.png)

Note that certain menu implementations, like the Command Palette, don't show commands that are disabled. There is also some semantic overlap between `enablement` of commands and the `when` clause of menu items. The `enablement` clause defines the enabled state for all representations of a command while the `when` clause defines when a command should be included in a menu. For instance, an explorer context menu item might only make sense for certain file types, such as TypeScript files, while enabling that command might depend on another condition, for example "TypeScript server running". You can learn more about commands and menus in the [Command Extension Guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/command#enablement-of-commands).

### Updated Octicons

We have added new icons to the Octicon library:

![New Octicons icons](images/1_35/octicons-update.png)

```$(error) $(info) $(info-outline) $(smiley) $(smiley-outline) $(warning)```

We have also updated existing icons to be a consistent size:

![Updated Octicons icons](images/1_35/octicons-update2.png)

```$(beaker) $(bell) $(info-outline) $(tools)```

**Note:** We also changed the default for `$(info) $(smiley)` to be a solid version and the previous Octicons were renamed to `$(info-outline) $(smiley-outline)`.

### New theme color for active tab of an inactive editor group

A new color `tab.unfocusedActiveBackground` allows you to control the background color of the active tab in an editor group that does not have focus. This color inherits from the `tab.activeBackground` color.

### Webviews that set retainContextWhenHidden can now receive messages when in the background

Webviews that set `retainContextWhenHidden` can now receive messages even if they are not visible. Previously, only visible webviews could receive messages using `.postMessage`.

Keep in mind that for a good user experience, webviews should not perform complex operations such as DOM manipulation or network requests while in the background.

### Comments API

We have finalized the Comments API for extensions to provide commenting support within VS Code. For example, the [GitHub Pull Request](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github) extension uses the Comments API to create and update comments for open pull requests directly in the editor and a dedicated Comments Panel.

You can play with the [comment sample extension](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-extension-samples/tree/master/comment-sample) to get a better understanding of the API or take a deep look at the [GitHub Pull Request extension repository](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-pull-request-github/pull/1168).

### Uninstall extension command

There is a new command, `workbench.extensions.uninstallExtension`, to programmatically uninstall an installed extension.

```typescript
vscode.commands.executeCommand('workbench.extensions.uninstallExtension', 'ms-python.python');
```

## Debug Adapter Protocol

Thanks to [Andrew Crawley](https://github.com/andrewcrawley), the Debug Adapter Protocol better supports hardware-oriented debuggers that need to surface processor registers and memory contents. Both additions are optional, and new and existing debug adapters are not affected. However, if a debug adapter is interested in showing registers and/or memory contents, it can opt into these features. Note that the debugger frontend also needs to add support: Visual Studio plans to support both and we have not yet decided for Visual Studio Code.

### Support for reading registers

Register support for DAP has been retrofitted to the existing "Scope" mechanism: a debug adapter can return a set of CPU registers to the frontend as an additional scope in the `scopes` request. To mark a scope as a "register" scope, a new optional `presentationHint` attribute and a value `registers` has been added to the `Scopes` type. Using this hint is all that is needed to opt into the feature; there is no corresponding capability.

### Support for memory access and disassembly

This feature centers around "memory references." A memory reference is an opaque identifier that can be used (along with an optional byte offset) to identify a single location in memory. A debug adapter has the option of providing a memory reference on DAP responses that represent things a debugger frontend might want to display in a memory view or use as the starting point for disassembly, for example `EvaluateResponse` and `Variable`. Providing memory references could be expensive for a debug adapter, so the frontend announces that it can actually use memory references by sending a `supportsMemoryReferences` capability in the `initialize` request.

With a memory reference in hand, a debugger frontend can read memory via a new `readMemory` request and can disassemble source code via a new `disassemble` request. If a debug adapter implements these requests, it announces this via the two capabilities, `supportsReadMemoryRequest` and `supportsDisassembleRequest`.

## Proposed extension APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always we are keen on your feedback. This is what you have to do to try out a proposed API:

* You must use Insiders because proposed APIs change frequently.
* You must have this line in the `package.json` file of your extension: `"enableProposedApi": true`.
* Copy the latest version of the [`vscode.proposed.d.ts`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/vscode.proposed.d.ts) file into your project.

Note that you cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. We may likely make breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.

### DocumentLink.tooltip

The proposed `DocumentLink.tooltip` property allows a `DocumentLinkProvider` to customize the text displayed when a user hovers over a document link:

![Custom hover text displayed for a Markdown link](images/1_35/proposed-documentlink-tooltip.png)

VS Code includes instructions on how to activate the link (`Cmd+click to` in this example) along with the `tooltip` text.

### Background terminals

The new proposed `runInBackground` terminal option lets extension authors create terminals but not surface them through the UI. Background terminals will become regular terminals visible to the user once `Terminal.show()` is called for the first time.

```ts
// Create a background terminal
const terminal = window.createTerminal({ runInBackground: true });

// Show the terminal in the panel
terminal.show();
```

This is useful if you need an interactive terminal session but don't want to display it to the user unless something goes wrong.

## New documentation

### Remote Development topics

The VS Code Remote Development extensions are still in preview but there is extensive [documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/remote-overview) to help you get started.

There are specific topics for each Remote Development extension:

* [Remote - SSH](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh) - Connect to any location by opening folders on a remote machine/VM using SSH.
* [Remote - Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) - Work with a sandboxed toolchain or container-based application inside (or mounted into) a container.
* [Remote - WSL](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/wsl) - Get a Linux-powered development experience in the Windows Subsystem for Linux.

Under the [Remote](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote) table of contents, you will also find a [Tips and Tricks](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/troubleshooting) guide as well as [FAQ](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/faq).
