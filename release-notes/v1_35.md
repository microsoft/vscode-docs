## Insiders Release

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the May 1.35 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll see details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the May release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[Commit Log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/89?closed=1)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people taking a look at our new features as soon as they are ready so check back here often and learn what's new to try out.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the VS Code repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues).
