## Workbench

### Easier Display Language configuration

Running the **Configure Display Language** command will now open a Quick Pick listing the available locales based on the Language Packs you have installed, instead of only opening the `locale.json` file. When you make a selection, the locale will be automatically updated and you'll be prompted to restart VS Code for the change to take effect.

![Configure Display Language Quick Pick](images/1_33/display-language-picker.png)

### Improved Source Control view

The Source Control view has been aligned to behave like other views, such as the File Explorer, Debug view, etc. Repositories can now be made visible or hidden using context menu actions. Their order and sizing is now preserved. You can also show or hide the **Source Control Providers** view with context menu actions.

![Source Control view context menu](images/1_33/source-control-context-menu.png)

The Source Control view also now behaves like the **Open Editors** view and resizes itself up to a certain number of source control providers. If you'd like to disable the automatic resizing and prefer to resize it manually, set the newly introduced `scm.providers.visible` setting to `0`.

### List simple keyboard navigation when screen reader detected

When VS Code detects that a screen reader is being used, it automatically turns on simple keyboard navigation for lists. This makes the list keyboard navigation easier for users with a screen reader since each key stroke will navigate to the corresponding item. This behavior applies for all lists and trees in the workbench, for example the File Explorer, Open Editors, and Debug views.

## Editor

### IntelliSense customization

There are new settings that control the IntelliSense display:

* `editor.suggest.filteredTypes` - Filter specific types from IntelliSense, for instance keywords are filtered with: `{ "keyword": false }`.
* `editor.suggest.maxVisibleSuggestions` - Control the number of items IntelliSense shows at once.
* `editor.suggest.showIcons` - Enable or disable displaying icons in IntelliSense.

Below is an example of TypeScript IntelliSense with keywords filtered out, no icons, and limited to eight suggestions:

![IntelliSense: no keywords, no icons, only eight entries](images/1_33/intellisense-config.png)

### Default formatter selection

Many of our users work on different projects and often different projects use different document formatters. This has been hard to configure and we have added a new setting to help, `editor.defaultFormatter`. Now, when there are multiple formatters available, you can define one as the default. In fact, VS Code will encourage you to pick a default formatter.

![Pick Default Formatter](images/1_33/formatter-default.gif)

This will update your configuration (as shown below) so that for subsequent save operations, VS Code knows what formatter to pick. We also encourage you to set this value in your project's configuration. For example, if your project team agrees on a formatter, then it should be spelled out in the project settings file.

```json
"[javascript]": {
  "editor.defaultFormatter": "HookyQR.beautify"
}
```

Defining a default formatter does not remove alternative formatters. We have added the **Format Document With...** command, which still allows you to pick a formatter before formatting a document. If needed, you can also reconfigure the default formatter from the dropdown.

### Go To Definition customization

Some programming languages allow you to define a symbol in multiple locations. This means that a feature like **Go to Definition** must go to multiple locations at once. VS Code supports this by showing a Peek view with all locations. This behavior can now be fine-tuned with a new setting, `editor.gotoLocation.multiple`.

It can be set to these values:

* `peek` - Open Peek view at the current location. This is the default.
* `gotoAndPeek` - Open the primary location (as defined by the extension) and also show a Peek view.
* `goto` - Only open the primary location.

### Snippet variable $WORKSPACE_NAME

There is a new snippet variable that resolves to the name of the opened workspace/folder: `$WORKSPACE_NAME`.

Use it as shown in the snippet below:

```json
"header": {
  "scope": "javascript,typescript",
  "prefix": "workspace",
  "body": ["// the ${WORKSPACE_NAME}-project"],
  "description": "Log output to console"
}
```

## Integrated Terminal

### ConPTY turned on by default on Windows build 18309+

For supporting versions of Windows 10 Insiders, the new terminal back-end ConPTY will be turned on by default. This should result in a more stable experience closer to the native terminal and adds 256 color support. If you experience issues, please let [us](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues) or the [Windows Console team](https://github.com/Microsoft/console/issues) know. You can always opt out with this setting:

```json
{
  "terminal.integrated.windowsEnableConpty": false
}
```

### Data parsing capped to 12 ms

Previously, the amount of data parsed by the terminal was not being capped properly. This meant that on less powerful hardware, the amount of time parsing data and rendering would far exceed the ideal time to render a frame, resulting in laggy UI or a full lock up for commands that generated a lot of output. There is now a cap in place, which prevents this from exceeding approximately 12 ms, which should avoid these issues.

## Languages

### TypeScript 3.4

VS Code now ships with [TypeScript 3.4.1](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-3-4/). This update adds support for some new TypeScript language features—such as improved inference and new `const` assertions—as well as bringing tooling improvements and bug fixes.

### Convert to destructured parameters refactoring

The new **Convert to named parameters** refactoring for TypeScript lets you quickly organize long function parameter lists by converting the function to take a single named parameter object.

![Cleaning up a long parameter list](images/1_33/ts-named-paramters.gif)

### Option to disable CSS property value completion

A new setting, `css.completion.triggerPropertyValueCompletion`, allows you to disable property value completion. For example, if you choose `position` from `p` and have this setting set to `false`, VS Code will not trigger the `static | absolute | sticky | ...` completions for the property value.

This is useful if you would like to use `Tab/Shift + Tab` to select previous and next completion items.

## Debugging

### Support for subsessions

In this milestone, we have added support to display debug sessions as a tree in the debugger UI. Previously debug session were displayed as a flat list, which made it difficult to grasp that sessions were related.

Since this functionality is available via a new extension API, it requires adoption by debugger extensions. In this milestone, the only debugger that makes use of hierarchical debug sessions is VS Code's Node.js debugger.

In Node.js cluster debugging, all subprocesses of a cluster are registered under the main debug session:

![Node.js subprocesses under main debug session](images/1_33/sub-sessions.png)

In the "server-ready feature" (see below), an automatically launched Chrome browser session is registered as a child of the server debug session.

### Automatically open a URI

The last milestone had a [preview version of the "server ready" feature](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_32#_automatically-open-a-uri-when-debugging-a-server-program), which allows you to open a URL in a web browser automatically as soon as a specific program output message is detected. This feature is useful for debugging web server source code because the URL opened in the browser can make the server hit a breakpoint as soon as the server is ready (and this all with a single `F5` key press).

In this milestone, we've moved the feature out of preview. VS Code looks for the trigger message not only in the Debug Console but also in the Integrated Terminal. In addition, we've also improved the error handling.

Note that for technical reasons, it is not possible to support the "server ready" feature in external terminals.

## Extensions

### Install missing dependencies

We've improved the extension activation failure notification when VS Code detects a missing extension dependency and now provide an action to install the missing dependency.

![Extension missing dependency warning](images/1_33/extension-dep-install.png)

You can also install all missing dependencies using the new **Extensions: Install Missing Dependencies** command.

### Network proxy support for extensions

We now load the SSL/TLS certificates from the operating system and include them when validating `https` requests initiated by extensions. This supports proxies using their own SSL/TLS certificates and other setups with custom certificates.

In addition, `http`/`https` requests from extensions now honor the `NO_PROXY` environment variable, which lists the domain names separated by commas for which all proxy settings should be ignored.

## Preview features

Preview features are not ready for release but are functional enough to use. We welcome your early feedback while they are under development.

### Call Hierarchy

A call hierarchy view shows all calls from or to a function and allows you to drill into callers of callers and calls of calls. The image below shows that function `foo` is being called by `bar` and `bang`, then `bar` is being called by `bang` and `fib`.

![Call Hierarchy view](images/1_33/call-hierarchy.png)

This is a preview feature and there aren't any extensions currently providing real data for it. However, if you are an extension author, we invite you to validate our proposed API. If you are interested, there is a sample extension for testing: https://github.com/jrieken/demo-callhierarchy.

## Extension authoring

### Smart select API

We have finalized the smart select API used with the **Expand Selection** (`kb(editor.action.smartSelect.expand)`) and **Shrink Selection** (`kb(editor.action.smartSelect.shrink)`) commands.  With this API, extensions can define the ranges that get selected in the editor.

### Install extension command

A new command `workbench.extensions.installExtension` was introduced to install an extension from the Marketplace or a VSIX.

To install an extension from the Marketplace, you provide its identifier.

```typescript
vscode.commands.executeCommand('workbench.extensions.installExtension', 'ms-python.python');
```

To install via a VSIX, you provide its location URI.

```typescript
vscode.commands.executeCommand('workbench.extensions.installExtension', vscode.Uri.file('path-to-vsix'));
```

### Debug toolbar contributions support positioning

It is now possible to position the contributed debug commands in any order in the Debug toolbar. The default debug commands are using the group `navigation` so if you would like your contributed commands to be mixed with the default ones, use the same group. More information about sorting inside groups can be found in the [contribution points documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/contribution-points#Sorting-inside-groups).

For consistency, we are deprecating the menu ID `debug/toolbar` in favor of `debug/toolBar`. In the March release, we will support both menu IDs, but in April, support for the `debug/toolbar` menu ID will be removed.

### "sidebarVisible" context renamed to "sideBarVisible"

For consistency, we are deprecating the context `sidebarVisible` in favor of `sideBarVisible`. In the March release, both contexts will be supported, but in the April release, support for `sidebarVisible` will be dropped.

### TerminalOptions.shellArgs now accepts strings on Windows

Previously `TerminalOptions.shellArgs` only supported a list of arguments in the form `string[]`. This could cause issues on Windows as the string array needs to be converted into the [command-line format](https://msdn.microsoft.com/08dfcab2-eb6e-49a4-80eb-87d4076c98c6) and the conversion could go wrong or be hard to get right for complicated cases. You can now bypass this conversion process on Windows by using a `string` in command-line format directly.

### Hierarchical debug sessions

In order to support hierarchical debug sessions, we've added an optional argument `parentSession` to the `vscode.debug.startDebugging` API. If specified, VS Code shows the debug session resulting from `startDebugging` in a tree-like way as a child of the parent session.

### Removing the vscode.previewHtml command

The `vscode.previewHtml` command was used to render HTML pages in the editor before the [webview API](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/webview) was introduced last year. However the `vscode.previewHtml` command suffered from some important security and compatibility issues that we determined could not be fixed without breaking existing users of the command. So instead of trying to fix `vscode.previewHtml`, we have opted to remove the command entirely in VS Code 1.33.

We've tried to give all extensions that use the `vscode.previewHtml` command ample warning so that they can upgrade to use the webview API. However, there may still be a few extensions that are still using the `vscode.previewHtml` command and will therefore no longer work. If you are using one of these extensions, please file an issue against it or, even better, submit a PR with the fix.

## Proposed extension APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always, we welcome your feedback. This is what you have to do to try out a proposed API:

* You must use Insiders because proposed APIs change frequently.
* You must have this line in the `package.json` file of your extension: `"enableProposedApi": true`.
* Copy the latest version of the [`vscode.proposed.d.ts`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/vscode.proposed.d.ts) file into your project.

Note that you cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. We may likely make breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.

### Custom task execution

In addition to `ProcessExecution` and `ShellExecution` tasks, there is now a `CustomExecution` task. Instead of launching a process or running a script, it executes a callback provided by the extension.

````typescript
let execution = new vscode.CustomExecution((terminalRenderer, cancellationToken, args): Thenable<number> => {
        return new Promise<number>(resolve => {
            // This is the custom task callback!
            resolve(0);
        });
    });
const taskName = "First custom task";
let task = new vscode.Task2(kind, vscode.TaskScope.Workspace, taskName, taskType, execution);
````

This will give an extension provided task more flexibility for maintaining state when the task is run. It also provides access to the input and output for a task. For a complete example, see the [test item](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/71089).

### Commenting API

We did large refactoring around Commenting related features during the last two months, based on the lessons and experience we learned from the [GitHub Pull Requests](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github) extension and feedback from the community. The newly designed Commenting API is generic and powerful enough for different types of usage. The [GitHub Pull Requests](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github) extension has already moved to the new Commenting API.

The new interface is available in VS Code Insiders and we will use the April milestone to tune and tweak the API. The old Commenting API will also be removed in April. You can play with the [sample extension](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-extension-samples/pull/160) to get a better understanding of the API or take a deep look at [GitHub Pull Requests](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-pull-request-github).

### WebviewOptions.portMapping

The proposed `WebviewOptions.portMapping` setting allows extensions to transparently define how localhost ports are resolved inside of webviews.

```ts
const panel = vscode.window.createWebviewPanel('dog', "Dog Doodling", vscode.ViewColumn.One, {
    portMapping: [
        // Map localhost:3000 in the webview to localhost:4000 externally
        { port: 3000, resolvedPort: 4000 }
    ]
});

panel.webview.html =  `<!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <title>Dog Doodling</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <!--
            With the above port mapping, this image will actually be resolved
            to localhost:4000 on the local machine
        -->
        <img src="http://localhost:3000/canvas.png">
    </body>
    </html>`;
```

It is considered good practice to start services like live servers on a random port. With port mapping, a webview's HTML content can use a hard-coded port that is mapped to the dynamically opened port that the service is really running on.

### Call Hierarchy Provider

There is a proposed API for a `CallHierarchyItemProvider` supporting the call hierarchy feature. Try it out, leave [feedback](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/70231), and help us make this good API.

## Engineering

### Official Linux snap package

[We now fully support](https://blog.ubuntu.com/2019/04/04/visual-studio-code-launches-as-a-snap) distributing Visual Studio Code as a [snap package](https://snapcraft.io/code). Snaps work across many different Linux distributions, provide reliable execution environments for a much stabler VS Code, and support background updates. Yes, that's right, you now get in-product automatic updates for Linux just as the Windows and macOS users do. 🎉

[![Snap store](images/1_33/snap-store.png)](https://snapcraft.io/code)

Installing the snap package is as easy as:

```bash
sudo snap install code --classic
```

Are you an insider? Come on and jump over to the [Insiders snap package](https://snapcraft.io/code-insiders), and get daily updates without any extra work:

```bash
sudo snap install code-insiders --classic
```

### Caching NPM packages

Thanks to our friends over at Microsoft DevLabs, we were able to speed up our [OSS builds](https://dev.azure.com/vscode/VSCode/_build?definitionId=12) using an [Azure Pipelines extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=1ESLighthouseEng.PipelineArtifactCaching), which caches NPM packages and speeds up the entire `npm install` process. If you'd like to know more about this, you can read this [blog post](https://medium.com/microsoft-1es/reducing-vs-code-ci-build-times-e0c5872bfdde) by [Ethan Dennis](https://github.com/erdennis13).

### Strict null checking of VS Code

We made a final big push this iteration to enable TypeScript's strict null checking for the core VS Code codebase. Strict null checks help to catch some common programming mistakes and make our codebase more maintainable, so that we can keep moving quickly yet safely.

Enabling strict null checks for core VS Code was a six-month effort that involved at least 40 contributors and touched tens of thousands of lines of source code. You can read about how we went about incrementally enabling strict null checking in [issue #60565](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/60565).

## Contributions to extensions

### GitHub Pull Requests

This milestone we continued working on improvements to the [GitHub Pull Requests](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github) extension.

Below are some of the new features:

* New `workbench.action.addComment` and `workbench.action.submitComment` commands to customize the keyboard shortcuts for adding and submitting comments.
* Polished rendering of GitHub todo lists in the description page.
* Adoption of the new [Commenting API](#commenting-api).

### Vetur

The [Vetur](https://github.com/vuejs/vetur) extension now supports any workspace version of TypeScript > 2.8, so that users get more consistent language support between `*.vue`, `*.js`, and `*.ts` files.

Other than making available the new TypeScript language features and bug fixes, Vetur also improved its integration with TypeScript to bring grayed-out unused variables, code actions (autofixes), and auto import to `*.vue` files.

![Vetur TypeScript features](images/1_33/vetur-ts-features.gif)

Read more on these features in the [Vetur Changelog](https://github.com/vuejs/vetur/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

## New documentation

### Node remote debugging

The new [Remote Debugging for Node.js](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/azure/remote-debugging) topic explains how you can connect the VS Code debugger to your Node.js applications running on [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com) with the [Azure App Service](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azureappservice) extension.

![Azure App Service extension](images/1_33/azure-app-service.png)
