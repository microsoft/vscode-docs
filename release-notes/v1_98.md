## GitHub Copilot

TODO: @ntrogh to reference agent mode blog post

### Copilot Edits

#### Refined editor integration

We have polished the integration of Copilot Edits with code and notebook editors:

* We don't scroll along anymore as changes are being made. The viewport remains in place, making it easier to focus on what changes.
* We have renamed the edit review actions from "Accept" to "Keep" and "Discard" to "Undo". This reflects better what's happening: changes for Copilot Edits are live, they are applied and saved as they are made and users keep or undo them.
* Lastly, when you have decided to keep or undo a file, the next file is automatically revealed.

The recording below shows how edits are applied and saved as they are made. The live preview updates and the user decided to "Keep" the changes. Undoing and further tweaking is also possible.

<video src="images/1_98/edits_editor.mp4" title="Changes from Copilot Edits are saved automatically and the user decided to keep them" autoplay loop controls muted></video>

#### Refreshed UI

In preparation for unifying Copilot Edits with Copilot Chat, we've given Copilot Edits a facelift. Files that are attached and not yet sent, are now rendered as regular chat attachments. Only files that have been modified with AI are added to the changed files list, which is located above the chat input part. Related file suggestions are rendered below chat attachments when configuring `setting(chat.renderRelatedFiles)`.

### Removed working set size limits

There is no longer a limit of 10 files for the working set in Copilot Edits. Additionally, we've removed the client-side rate limit of 14 interactions per 10 minutes. Note that service-side usage rate limits still apply.

### Smoother permission upgrade flows

For Copilot users who host their repositories on GitHub, you're able to leverage several features including advanced code searching, the `@github` chat participant, and more! For private GitHub repositories, however, we need to have permission to interact with your repositories on GitHub. For a while, this was presented with our usual VS Code Authentication flow with a modal dialog showing up when you invoke certain functionality (asking `@workspace` or `@github` a question, using the `#codebase` tool, etc.).

To smooth this out we've introduced this confirmation in chat:

![a confirmation dialog](images/1_98/confirmation-auth-dialog.png)

Not only is it not as jarring as a modal, but it has new functionality:

1. **Grant:** You're taken through the authentication flow as you've seen it before (via the modal).
2. **Not Now:** Your choice will be remembered, and we won't bother you again until your next VS Code window session. The only exception to this is if the feature needs this additional permission to function, like `@github`.
3. **Never Ask Again:** Your choice will be remembered and persisted via the setting `setting(github.copilot.advanced.authPermissions)`. Any feature that needs this additional permission will fail.

It's important to note that this confirmation does not confirm/deny Copilot, the platform, access to your repositories. This is only how VS Code's Copilot experience authenticates. To configure what Copilot can access, please read the docs [on content exclusion](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/configuring-and-auditing-content-exclusion/excluding-content-from-github-copilot).

### Attachable Problems

You now can attach problems to your chat request, either by dragging them from the Problems view into the chat view, by typing `#problems` in chat, or by clicking the paperclip 📎 button. You can attach specific problems, all problems in a file, or all files in your codebase.

### Copilot Vision (Public Preview)

We're introducing end-to-end vision support in this version of GitHub Copilot Chat. This lets you attach images and interact with images in Copilot Chat prompts. For example, if you're encountering an error while debugging, quickly attach a screenshot of VS Code and ask Copilot to help you resolve the issue.

![Screenshot that shows an attached image in a Copilot Chat prompt. Hovering over the image shows a preview of it.](images/1_97/image-attachments.gif)

You can now attach images using several methods:

- Drag and drop images from your OS or from the Explorer view
- Paste an image from your clipboard
- Attach a screenshot of the VS Code window (click the paperclip 📎 button > Screenshot Window)

A warning is shown if the selected model currently does not have the capability to handle the file type. `GPT 4o`, `Claude 3.5 Sonnet`, and `Gemini 2.0 Flash` will support image attachments. Currently, the supported image types are `JPEG/JPG`, `PNG`, `GIF`, and `WEBP`.

## Accessibility

### Copilot Edits

We made Copilot Edits much more accessible. There are now audio signals for files with modifications and for changed regions (insertions, modifications, and deletions). The accessible diff viewer is now available for modified files. Just as in diff editors select `kb(chatEditor.action.showAccessibleDiffView)` to enable it.

### `activeEditorState` window title variable

We have a new `setting(window.title)` variable, `activeEditorState`, to indicate editor information such as modified state, the number of problems, and when a file has pending Copilot Edits to screen reader users. When in Screen Reader Optimized mode, this is appended by default and can be disabled with `setting(accessibility.windowTitleOptimized:false)`.

## Workbench

### Custom title bar on Linux

The custom title bar is now enabled by default on Linux:

![Screenshot that shows the custom VS Code title bar on Linux.](images/1_97/custom-title.png)

You can always revert back to the native title decorations, either from the custom title context menu or by configuring `setting(window.titleBarStyle)` to `native`.

![Screenshot that shows the content menu option to disable the custom title bar on Linux.](images/1_97/restore-title.png)

We are happy for continued feedback on this experience and are already working on improving this for future milestones based on existing feedback.

### Use labels for Secondary Side Bar views

We decided to change the appearance of views in the Secondary Side Bar to show labels instead of icons, similar to what we have in the Panel area. This makes it easier to distinguish between the **Copilot Edits** and **Copilot Chat** views. You can always go back to showing icons by configuring `setting(workbench.secondarySideBar.showLabels)`.

![Screenshot that shows secondary sidebar with labels instead of icons.](images/1_98/aux-sidebar.png)

### New Settings editor key-matching algorithm

We have added a new Settings editor search algorithm that prioritizes more relevant key matches. Try it out by enabling the `setting(workbench.settings.useWeightedKeySearch:true)` setting.

## Editor

### Peek References Support Drag & Drop

The peek view now supports drag & drop. Invoke Peek References, Peek Implementation and any of the other peek commands and drag entries from its tree to open them as separate editors.

<!--

## Source Control

### Updated View Titles

The addition of the "Source Control Graph" view to the "Source Control" viewlet has highlighted the duplication present in the source control view titles: "Source Control Repositories", "Source Control", and "Source Control Graph". This milestone we have revisited the titles of the views so that they are shorter and do not duplicate the viewlet title: "Repositories", "Changes", and "Graph".

### Discard Untracked Changes Improvements

Over the years we have received multiple reports about data loss as discarding an untracked file would permanently delete the file even though VS Code shows a modal dialog making it clear that the file will be permanently deleted. Starting this milestone discarding an untracked file will move the file to the Recycle Bin/Trash when possible so that the file can be easily recovered. You can disable this functionality using the setting(git.discardUntrackedChangesToTrash) setting.

### Diagnostics Commit Hook (Experimental)

This milestone we have added a new commit hook that will prompt the user if there are any unresolved diagnostics for the changed files. This is currently an experimental feature that can be enabled using the setting(git.diagnosticsCommitHook.Enabled:true) setting. By default, the commit hook will prompt for any error level diagnostics but the diagnostics sources and levels can be customized using the setting(git.diagnosticsCommitHook.Sources) setting. Please give it a try and let us know your feedback.

## Notebooks

### Inline notebook diff view (Experimental)

You can now enable an inline diff view for notebooks. This feature allows you to view changes within notebook cells in a single, inline view rather than the traditional side-by-side comparison.

Enable this feature by setting the `setting(notebook.diff.experimental.toggleInline:true)` setting to `true`. You can then toggle the diff view to inline using the editor menu in the top right corner.

<video src="images/1_98/inline_notebook_diff.mp4" title="Toggle from side-by-side to an inline diff for notebooks" autoplay loop controls muted></video>

### Notebook inline values hover

<!-- TODO@Yoyokrazy -->

## Terminal

### Terminal completions improvements (Preview)

We've significantly improved shell completions across Bash, Zsh, Fish, and PowerShell by adding completion specs (`git` for example), refining command-line parsing for better suggestions, and enhancing file and folder completions. Enable this feature with `setting(terminal.integrated.suggest.enabled:true)`.

### Improved parsing

We now leverage Fig’s parsing to support subcommands and arguments across a wider range of commands.

### Configurable completion behavior

Gain precise control over when completions appear using `setting(terminal.integrated.suggest.quickSuggestions)`.

### Inline suggestion detection

With enhanced ghost text detection, inline suggestions now appear as the top completion result and can be accepted with `Tab`. Configure this behavior with `setting(terminal.integrated.suggest.inlineSuggestion)`.

### Enhanced documentation support

Built-in commands for Zsh and Bash now include descriptions and documentation, providing details on available arguments. This information is sourced directly from each shell’s help documentation.

### Improved sorting

Commands with completion specs and built-in commands now appear before those fetched from `$PATH` as executables.

### Alias support

Command aliases are now displayed with a distinct icon, with the corresponding command shown as a description.

### New icons

Enhanced parsing introduces specific icons for different completion types, improving clarity and usability.

### `$CDPATH` support

`$CDPATH` is a shell feature that enables seamless navigation to directories by treating specified paths as implicit search locations. With `$CDPATH` set, users can `cd` into a directory without needing to specify its full path.

For example, setting `CDPATH=/dev` allows running `cd vscode` to navigate directly to `/dev/vscode`, regardless of the current working directory.

This functionality is now integrated into the suggest widget, enhancing usability by recognizing and completing paths based on `$CDPATH`.

## Tasks

### Task rerun action

We have a new rerun task action for terminals, `kb(workbench.action.tasks.rerunForActiveTerminal)`. The action appears on the terminal tab's inline toolbar and in the terminal's context menu.

<video src="images/1_98/terminal-rerun-task.mp4" title="Terminal rerun task" autoplay loop controls muted></video>


## Debug

### Debug Inline Values Hover

## Testing


## Languages

### TypeScript 5.8

VS Code now includes TypeScript 5.8.2. This major update brings new language improvements, including [improved checking of types from conditional expressions](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-5-8/) and [support for write code that confirms to Node's new --experimental-strip-types option](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-5-8/#the---erasablesyntaxonly-option). It also included a number of tooling improvements and bug fixes.

Check out the [TypeScript 5.8 release blog](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-5-8/) for more details on this update.

## Remote Development

The [Remote Development extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack), allow you to use a [Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers), remote machine via SSH or [Remote Tunnels](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/tunnels), or the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl) (WSL) as a full-featured development environment.

Highlights include:

- TODO @ntrogh: add remote highlights here

You can learn more about these features in the [Remote Development release notes](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/blob/main/remote-release-notes/v1_98.md).

## Contributions to extensions

### Python

#### Automatic quotation insertion when breaking long strings

[Pylance](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.vscode-pylance) now supports automatic insertion of quotation marks to enable a seamless experience when breaking long strings.

#### Pylance memory consumption improvements

Some optimizations were made to improve Pylance's memory consumption, particularly when working with large workspaces. [This enhancement](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright/pull/9993) was made to Pyright, the static type checker that powers Pylance's language server features.

#### Improvements to Python shell integration

After modifying `setting(python.terminal.shellIntegration.enabled)`, you will no longer have to reload in order for changes to take effect. Simply create a new terminal to see desired changes on your Python REPL in terminal.

#### Correct workspace prompt for Windows Gitbash

Python users on Windows using Gitbash will now see correct working directory in their terminal prompt.
These changes apply to those opted into the `pythonTerminalEnvVarActivation` experiment.

#### New setting for auto test discovery file pattern

You can now refine which files auto test discovery occurs by specifying a glob pattern in the `setting(python.testing.autoTestDiscoverOnSavePattern)` setting. Its default value is set to `**/*.py`.

#### Read test debug config from settings.json as fallback

We now look for test debug configurations in both `settings.json` and `launch.json` files, expanding where you can define these configurations.


### GitHub Pull Requests and Issues

### GitHub authentication

#### Improved proxy support with Electron `fetch` adoption

The GitHub Authentication extension now leverages Electron's version of `fetch` in order to make web requests. This has helped users with certain proxy & firewall settings. If you know you run in an environment that has a proxy setup and you are unable to authenticate to GitHub inside of VS Code, please don't hesitate to create an issue!

## Preview features

### Agent mode improvements (Experimental)

Last month, we introduced _agent mode_ for Copilot Edits in [VS Code Insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/). When in agent mode, Copilot can automatically search your workspace for relevant context, edit files, check them for errors, and run terminal commands (with your permission) to complete a task end-to-end.

We made some improvements to the UX of tool usages this month. Terminal commands are now shown inline so that you can keep track of which commands were run, and you can edit the command before accepting it if you'd like to tweak the LLM's suggestion:

<video src="images/1_98/edit-terminal.mp4" title="Editing terminal command" autoplay loop controls muted></video>

You can also easily confirm a terminal command with `kb(workbench.action.chat.acceptTool)`

You can also expand the message to see the results of searches that were done.

![Expandable agent tool results](images/1_98/image.png)

We've also made many improvements to the prompt and behavior of agent mode, so it should seem at least a little smarter.

The undo and redo actions in chat now undo or redo the last file edit made in a chat response. This is useful for agent mode, as you can now undo certain steps the model took without rolling back the entire chat response.

The agent can now run your build [tasks](/docs/editor/tasks) automatically or when instructed to do so. This is capability can be toggled off via the `setting(github.copilot.chat.agent.runTasks)` setting, in the event that you see the model running tasks when it should not.

Agent mode is still currently only available in [VS Code Insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/), but we are working on stabilizing it to a point where it can be enabled for VS Code Stable users. If the `setting(chat.agent.enabled)` setting doesn't show up for you in Stable, then it isn't enabled for you yet.

![Screenshot of the agent mode setting in the Settings editor](images/1_97/agent-setting.png)

Learn more about [agent mode in Copilot Edits](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-edits#_use-agent-mode-preview) in the VS Code documentation.

> **Note**: If you are a Copilot Business or Enterprise user, an administrator of your organization [must opt in](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-github-copilot-in-your-organization/managing-policies-for-copilot-in-your-organization#enabling-copilot-features-in-your-organization) to the use of Copilot "Editor Preview Features" for agent mode to be available.

### Copilot Status Bar

We are experimenting with a new central Copilot related Status Bar entry that provides:

* Quota information if you are a [Copilot Free](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2024/12/18/free-github-copilot) user
* Editor related settings such as Code Completions
* Useful keyboard shortcuts to use other Copilot features

<video src="images/1_98/copilot-status.mp4" title="Copilot Status Bar" autoplay loop controls muted></video>

You can enable this new Status Bar entry by configuring the new `setting(chat.experimental.statusIndicator.enabled)` setting.

### `#codebase` with tool calling in chat queries

When you add `#codebase` to your Copilot Chat query, `#codebase` can now run tools like text search and file search to pull in additional context from your workspace. Set `setting(github.copilot.chat.codesearch.enabled)` to enable this behavior. The full list of tools is:

* Embeddings-based semantic search
* Text search
* File search
* Git modified files
* Project structure
* Read file
* Read directory
* Workspace symbol search

### Notebook support in Copilot Edits (Preview)

We are introducing notebook support in Copilot Edits. You can now use Copilot to edit notebook files with the same intuitive experience as editing code files - creating new notebooks from scratch, modifying content across multiple cells, inserting and deleting cells, and changing cell types. This preview feature provides a seamless workflow when working with data science or documentation notebooks.

> For the best notebook editing experience with Copilot, we recommend using [VS Code Insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/) and the pre-release version of GitHub Copilot Chat, where you'll get the latest improvements to this feature as they're developed.

## Extension Authoring

### Bring authentication interactive settings of `forceNewSession` to `createIfNone` and rename `AuthenticationForceNewSessionOptions` to `AuthenticationGetSessionPresentationOptions`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We are renaming `AuthenticationForceNewSessionOptions` to `AuthenticationGetSessionPresentationOptions` and leaving a deprecated `AuthenticationForceNewSessionOptions` for now. There is no functional difference so this is not a breaking change in the runtime, but you should update your code to use `AuthenticationGetSessionPresentationOptions` instead of `AuthenticationForceNewSessionOptions` since it will be removed in the future.

Looking at these two authentication calls:
```ts
vscode.authentication.getSession(provider, scopes, { createIfNone: options });
vscode.authentication.getSession(provider, scopes, { forceNewSession: options });
```

`createIfNone` and `forceNewSession` will now take in either a `boolean` or a `AuthenticationGetSessionPresentationOptions`:
```ts
/**
 * Optional options to be used when calling {@link authentication.getSession} with interactive options `forceNewSession` & `createIfNone`.
 */
export interface AuthenticationGetSessionPresentationOptions {
	/**
	 * An optional message that will be displayed to the user when we ask to re-authenticate. Providing additional context
	 * as to why you are asking a user to re-authenticate can help increase the odds that they will accept.
	 */
	detail?: string;
}
```
_[full typings can be found here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/release/1.98/src/vscode-dts/vscode.d.ts#L17520-L17551)_...

This is a new addition for `createInNone`, but it's a modification for `forceNewSession` which use to take in a `AuthenticationForceNewSessionOptions` which had the same signature of this new `AuthenticationGetSessionPresentationOptions`.

If you are explicitly using `AuthenticationForceNewSessionOptions`, you will see it is marked as deprecated and you should replace it with `AuthenticationGetSessionPresentationOptions` as `AuthenticationForceNewSessionOptions` will be removed in a future version.

It's important to note that the only thing that is changing here are the types. **There is no runtime change so this is not a breaking change from that perspective.**

Additionally, the `authLearnMore` [proposed API](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/release/1.98/src/vscode-dts/vscode.proposed.authLearnMore.d.ts), has been updated from `AuthenticationForceNewSessionOptions` to `AuthenticationGetSessionPresentationOptions`.

Here's an example that leverages `detail` and the `learnMore` proposal:
![auth presentation modal featuring a detail that says 'To get more relevant Copilot Chat results, we need permission to read the contents of your repository on GitHub.' and a learnMore button](images/1_98/auth-presentation.png)

### Refined Snippet API

You can now control the whitespace normalization when inserting snippets. This applies to the [`insertSnippet`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/c202fb0bcfc7ac863f90756bdf668e801b96901d/src/vscode-dts/vscode.d.ts#L1306)-API and to the [`SnippetTextEdit`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/c202fb0bcfc7ac863f90756bdf668e801b96901d/src/vscode-dts/vscode.d.ts#L3753)-API and control is the indentation of additional lines of snippets are adjusted or not

```js
const snippet = `This is an indented
    snippet`;

// keepWhitespace: false, undefined
function indentedFunctionWithSnippet() {
    return `This is an indented
        snippet`; // adjusted indentation
}

// keepWhitespace: true
function indentedFunctionWithSnippet() {
    return `This is an indented
    snippet`; // original indentation
}

```

## Proposed APIs

### Text Encodings

We added new proposed API to work with [text encodings](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/501ee833b16b8e83ba656c46e0888aadd9d2db04/src/vscode-dts/vscode.proposed.textDocumentEncoding.d.ts#L1) in VS Code. Specifically, this new API allows to:
* get the current `encoding` of a `TextDocument`
* open a `TextDocument` with a specific `encoding`
* encode a `string` to a `Uint8Array` with a specific `encoding`
* decode a `Uint8Array` to a `string` using a specific `encoding`

Please try it out and let us know what you think [in this GitHub issue](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/241449).

### Shell Environment

Extensions will be able to access user's currently active shell environment information for pwsh, zsh, bash, and fish shell that are opened from the VS Code's integrated terminal. This is only enabled when `setting(terminal.integrated.shellIntegration.enabled)` is enabled.

User can decide whether or not to report their shell environment information with `setting(terminal.integrated.shellIntegration.environmentReporting)`

Give this a try and let us know what you think [in this GitHub issue](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/227467).

## Engineering


### Dev-time tracking of leaked disposables

VS Code uses the disposable-pattern for explicit resource management, e.g. to close files, clean up DOM elements, or remove event listeners. Not disposing of resources means memory is wasted and memory usage accumulates over time. We are constantly on the hunt for such leaks and have now added another tool for this. We utilize the [`FinalizationRegistry`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/FinalizationRegistry)-API as it will inform us when an object has been garbage collected. If such an object represented a `disposable`, which has not been disposed of, then we have a leak. These are collected and shown to the developers of VS Code so that we can clean things up as we go.
