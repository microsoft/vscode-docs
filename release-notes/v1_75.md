### Default type navigation mode

The new `workbench.list.typeNavigationMode` setting allows you to configure the default type navigation mode for lists. When set to `trigger`, the list will only go into type navigation mode once the `list.triggerTypeNavigation` command is run.

### Nushell environment resolution support

[Nushell](https://www.nushell.sh/) is now supported whenever user environment is resolved.

### New `VSCODE_RESOLVING_ENVIRONMENT` environment variable

When resolving user environment, VS Code will now set a new environment variable `VSCODE_RESOLVING_ENVIRONMENT` to `1`. This is useful for user scripts (eg `.bashrc`) that need to know whether they are being run in the context of resolving the user environment.

### Setting to configure shell environment resolution timeout

A new setting `application.shellEnvironmentResolutionTimeout` allows to increase the timeout for resolving the shell environment when that is required. By default, VS Code will wait up to 10 seconds for the environment to resolve but in certain cases with more complex shell setups, this was often not enough.

Refer to https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/supporting/faq#_resolving-shell-environment-fails for more information on this topic.

### New confirmation to open large files

To prevent accidental opening of very large files, especially in remote environments where this might have an actual cost due to network transfer, a confirmation is shown before opening the actual file. The limit can be tweaked via the new `workbench.editorLargeFileConfirmation` setting and has different defaults based on opening local files vs. remote files.

### File watcher supports `files.watcherExclude` glob patterns natively

The `files.watcherExclude` setting supports glob patterns for powerful exclusion rules of the file watcher. So far however, glob patterns were not supported natively by the library we use for file watching. In this milestone we [contributed](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/watcher/pull/106) support for glob patterns for exclusions for more efficient resource usage, especially on Linux.

For Linux, please refer to https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/linux#_visual-studio-code-is-unable-to-watch-for-file-changes-in-this-large-workspace-error-enospc for more information if you see file watching issues.

## Editor

<!-- Color decorators limit -->

<!-- Find UI improvement, Command: Go to X of Y in Editor Find -->

### Quick fix list is now scrollable

<!-- TODO: mjbvz -->

## Notebooks

<!-- Notebook Overview Ruler show cell editor warning/problems now -->

<!-- Notebook Diff change navigation -->

### Fallback rendering of output to a supported mimetype

Rich outputs in Jupyter Notebooks such as IPyWidgets are visible only during the lifetime of the kernel. Meaning when the notebook is closed and re-opened again, the outputs are no longer visible.
However in a number of these cases, the output can be rendered using a fallback mechanism. For example, an IPyWidget can in some cases (depending on the widget used) be rendered as a static image or HTML content.

As a result, users opening existing notebooks with matplotlib widgets (or similar widgets) can now see the output without having to re-execute the code.

## Languages

### JavaScript React language label is now JavaScript JSX

The `JavaScript React` language mode has been renamed to `JavaScript JSX` to reflect that JSX syntax is used by more than just React. `TypeScript React` has also been renamed to `TypeScript TSX`.

Note that only the language names shown in the UI have been changed. The internal language ids (`javascriptreact` and `typescriptreact`) remain unchanged for compatibility reasons.

## Contributions to extensions

### Python

#### Auto-select environment when VSCode is launched from an activated terminal

If a user launches VS Code via terminal with a conda or virtual environment already activated, VS Code now detects that and then either auto-selects the environment itself, or asks the user if they would like to make that environment their selected one; depending on the environment.

#### Select requirements files when creating environment

When creating virtual environment using the `Python: Create Environment` command, it finds requirement files in the workspace folder, and allows users to multi-select any number of requirements to install.

#### Select optional dependencies from `pyproject.toml`

Python extension detects and loads the optional dependencies provided in the `[project.optional-dependencies]` part of the `pyproject.toml` file. We use pip editable install command if we detect that the workspace contains a `pyproject.toml` along with any selected optional dependencies.

### Cell editor polish

VS Code can now use all editor line number options when `notebook.lineNumbers` is turned on. For example, with `"notebook.lineNumbers": "on"` and `"editor.lineNumbers": "relative"`, relative line numbers are displayed in cell editor.

### Cell commands

* Join Selected Cells (`notebook.cell.joinSelected`)

### GitHub Copilot

The [GitHub Copilot extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot) is an AI-powered code completion tool that helps you write code faster and smarter. You can use the Copilot extension in VS Code to generate code, or to learn from the code it generates.

GitHub Copilot is now generally available for businesses, with features like license management, organization-wide policy controls, and privacy protections. You can learn more in the [GitHub Copilot for Business announcement](https://github.blog/2022-12-07-github-copilot-is-generally-available-for-businesses/).

We've also added a new [AI topic](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/artificial-intelligence) to the VS Code docs that will help you get started with Copilot.

## Preview features

### TypeScript 5.0 support

This update includes support for the upcoming TypeScript 5.0 release. See the [TypeScript 5.0 iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/51362) for more details on what the TypeScript team is currently working on. Some editor tooling highlights:

* New `switch` and `case` completions help you fill in the both of `switch` statements more quickly.
* Work on enabling project wide IntelliSense on github.dev and vscode.dev.

To start using the TypeScript 5.0 nightly builds, install the [TypeScript Nightly](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-typescript-next) extension.

## Proposed APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always, we want your feedback. Here are the steps to try out a proposed API:

1. [Find a proposal that you want to try](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/tree/main/src/vscode-dts) and add its name to `package.json#enabledApiProposals`.
1. Use the latest [vscode-dts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vscode-dts) and run `vscode-dts dev`. It will download the corresponding `d.ts` files into your workspace.
1. You can now program against the proposal.

You cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. There may be breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.

### Let notebook renderer fallback to a different mimetype

Sometimes when rendering content, a [notebook render](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/notebook#notebook-renderer) may realize that is cannot render the item properly. Perhaps the renderer requires the kernel to be in a certain state for instance.

Previously for cases like this, the renderer's only option was to render an error message. We've added new proposed API though that let's a renderer throw a specially named error that makes VS Code silently fallback to rendering the other data stored on the notebook output item. An interactive chart renderer for instance could throw this error to fallback to make VS Code render the image data also stored on the current output item.

To trigger this fallback, simply throw an error with the name `vscode.fallbackToNextRenderer` in `renderOutputItem`:

```ts
throw new class extends Error {
    override name = 'vscode.fallbackToNextRenderer';
}();
```

This special error is only meant for cases where rendering is expected to fail in certain situations. If you renderer runs into an unexpected error, it should instead continue to show an error message.

## Engineering

### Utility Process for Extension Host

The utility process usage for extension host that is required for [process sandboxing](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2022/11/28/vscode-sandbox) is now enabled by default. There is still a setting (`extensions.experimental.useUtilityProcess`), which we will remove soon.

### Performance testing via command line

We introduced node modules that enable a set of performance tests from the command line. This helps us measuring performance regressions quickly. You can run such a performance test with the help of the `vscode-bisect` module. Just run `npx vscode-bisect --help` for how to operate this tool.

## Notable fixes

* [165123](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/165123) Allow to open a diff editor with two untitled sides
* [153786](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/153786) Have a command to open either side of a diff editor
