## Accessibility

### Diff navigation improvements

`Go to Next/Previous Change` now have audio cues to indicate if a line was inserted, deleted, or modified. Additionally, the line of the change is selected such that it can read by the screen reader.

### Terminal Accessibility Mode

The `Terminal: Enter Accessibility Mode` (`kb(workbench.action.terminal.enterAccessibilityMode)`) command allows screen readers to navigate through the terminal buffer via keyboard.

### Terminal Accessiblity Help

Similar to the `Show Accessibility Help` command in the editor, the `Terminal: Show Terminal Accessibility Help` (`kb(workbench.action.terminal.showAccessibilityHelp)`) command provides important information for screen reader users.

![Terminal accessiblity help is presented on top of the terminal](images/1_75/terminal-accessibility-help.png)


<!-- Workbench stuff  -->

## Workbench

### Easier opt-out of release notes after update

You can now opt out of reading the release notes after every update, directly from the release notes editor. This will reflect and update the `update.showReleaseNotes` setting.

![There's a checkbox inside the release notes editor which allows the user to opt out reading release notes after every update](images/1_75/release-notes.png)

### Improved multi-view resizing support

You can now resize multiple views at the same time by dragging the corners of the views.

</video>

### Improved grid layout

If an editor is minimized, the grid will now preserve that state when resizing the entire workbench or sidebars.

</video>

### Tree Find Widget: History support

The find widget inside trees now supports history navigation. You can use the up/down arrow keys to navigate through the history of your previous searches.

### Tree Find Widget: Contiguous matching support

The find widget inside trees now supports contiguous matching.

<video src="images/1_75/contiguous.mp4" placeholder="images/1_75/contiguous.mp4" autoplay loop controls muted title="Video showing the user toggling between contiguous and fuzzy find in the explorer tree">
    Sorry, your browser doesn't support HTML 5 video.
</video>

### List: Scroll by page

A new setting, `workbench.list.scrollByPage`, allows the user to configure whether the list should scroll by page when clicking directly on the scrollbar area.

### Default type navigation mode

The new `workbench.list.typeNavigationMode` setting allows you to configure the default type navigation mode for lists. When set to `trigger`, the list will only go into type navigation mode once the `list.triggerTypeNavigation` command is run.

### Nushell environment resolution support

[Nushell](https://www.nushell.sh/) is now supported whenever user environment is resolved.

### New `VSCODE_RESOLVING_ENVIRONMENT` environment variable

When resolving user environment, VS Code will now set a new environment variable `VSCODE_RESOLVING_ENVIRONMENT` to `1`. This is useful for user scripts (eg `.bashrc`) that need to know whether they are being run in the context of resolving the user environment.

### Setting to configure shell environment resolution timeout

A new setting `application.shellEnvironmentResolutionTimeout` allows to increase the timeout for resolving the shell environment when that is required. By default, VS Code will wait up to 10 seconds for the environment to resolve but in certain cases with more complex shell setups, this was often not enough.

Refer to this [FAQ entry](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/supporting/faq#_resolving-shell-environment-fails) for more information on this topic.

### New confirmation to open large files

To prevent accidental opening of very large files, especially in remote environments where this might have an actual cost due to network transfer, a confirmation is shown before opening the actual file. The limit can be tweaked via the new `workbench.editorLargeFileConfirmation` setting and has different defaults based on opening local files vs. remote files.

![Large file confirmation](images/1_75/large-file-confirm.png)

### File watcher supports `files.watcherExclude` glob patterns natively

The `files.watcherExclude` setting supports glob patterns for powerful exclusion rules of the file watcher. So far however, glob patterns were not supported natively by the library we use for file watching. In this milestone we [contributed](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/watcher/pull/106) support for glob patterns for exclusions for more efficient resource usage, especially on Linux.

For Linux, please refer to this [FAQ entry](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/linux#_visual-studio-code-is-unable-to-watch-for-file-changes-in-this-large-workspace-error-enospc) for more information if you see file watching issues.

### Simplified Global Settings Menu

We have simplified the global settings menu and organized the options into a more logical order and grouping.

![Global settings menu](images/1_75/global-settings-menu.png)

## Editor

<!-- Color decorators limit -->

<!-- Find UI improvement, Command: Go to X of Y in Editor Find -->

### Suggest Selection Mode

There is a new setting ()`editor.suggest.selectionMode`) that allows you to configure if suggestions are selected when showing automatically, e.g as you type or via trigger characters.

The default is to always select the best suggestion so that hitting Enter or Tab inserts it. If you prefer to not have a suggestion selected, set the setting to `never`, `whenQuickSuggestion`, or `whenTriggerCharacter`. That will still show suggestions but not select one automatically, so that you can use the arrow keys to select one.

<video src="images/1_75/suggest-select-mode.mp4" placeholder="images/1_75/suggest-select-mode.mp4" autoplay loop controls muted title="Suggest Select Mode">
    Sorry, your browser doesn't support HTML 5 video.
</video>

Please note that this setting only applies to automatic suggestions, not to suggestions that are shown when you explicitly trigger them via `Ctrl+Space`.

### Code action list is now scrollable

Some extensions generate long list of code actions. If we can't render them all, you can now scroll through the rest of the code action list:

<video src="images/1_75/code-action-scroll.mp4" placeholder="images/1_75/code-action-scroll.mp4" autoplay loop controls muted title="Video showing scrolling a long list of code actions">

</video>

## Terminal

### New default keybindings

The following default keybindings have been added to improve discoverability of advanced terminal features:

#### Open Detected Link `kbstyle(Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+O)`

This is the keyboard-accessible way of opening terminal links, it opens a quick pick with all available links in the terminal's viewport.

![Ctrl+Shift+O will open a quick pick with a categorized list of links found](images/1_75/terminal-open-link.png)

This keybinding was chosen as it's a similar action to go to symbol but for the terminal.

#### [Go to Recent Directory](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/shell-integration#_go-to-recent-directory) `kbstyle(Ctrl+G)`

This opens a quick pick with recent directories, picked up by [shell integration](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/shell-integration#_current-working-directory-detection). It supports pinning and fuzzy matching.

![Directories are presented in a quick pick, split up by the current and previous sessions.](images/1_75/terminal-go-to-dir.png)

This keybinding was chosen because `kbstyle(Ctrl+G)` is a relatively low-usage shell keybinding.

#### Send Ctrl+G to the shell `kbstyle(Ctrl+Alt+G)`

Since `kbstyle(Ctrl+G)` is now used to Go to Recent Directory, this is the new way to send Ctrl+G directly to the shell.

#### [Run Recent Command](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/shell-integration#_run-recent-command) `kbstyle(Ctrl+Alt+R)`

This opens a quick pick with recent commands that have been run, modeled after most shell's reverse index search (`kbstyle(Ctrl+R)`) but in a more accessible and more functional package. It supports pinning and fuzzy matching.

![Commands previously run are split up by current and previous sessions and also pulled in from the shell's history file](images/1_75/terminal-run-command.png)

This keybinding was chosen because it's an alternative behavior to `kbstyle(Ctrl+R)`, but that keybinding is too important to overwrite the defualt behavior of.

#### Accessibility mode overrides

Because reverse index search isn't very accessible to screen readers, when accessibility mode is on `kbstyle(Ctrl+R)` will trigger [Run Recent Command](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/shell-integration#_run-recent-command) and `kbstyle(Ctrl+Alt+R)` will send Ctrl+R to the shell.

### Link improvements

There have been many improvements to link detection in the terminal this release:

- Links containing spaces are detected under certain circumstances:
    - When the entire line is a link
    - Python-style stack trace links: `From "<path>", line <line>`
    - Some compiler errors: `<path>(<line>,<col>) : ...`
    - Independently-styled sections of text are all detected independently, so if a path is underlined it should be detected even if it has spaces
- Links containing `[` and `]` characters now work, they even support detection in difficult edge cases like this:
    ![Links that end in the \] character will be detected, even when the whole link is wrapped in \[ and \]](images/1_75/terminal-square-bracket.png)
- `vscode://` protocol links are now detected.
- `/mnt/`, `\\wsl$\` and `\\wsl.localhost\` links are now detected on Windows.
- [OSC hyperlink support was added in v1.72](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_72#_hyperlink-support), the common `file://` protocol often used in these links are now supported (eg. `ls --hyperlink`).
- The `terminal.integrated.enableFileLinks` setting now features a `"notRemote"` option, allowing it to be conditionally disabled only on remotes where the file existence checks can cause performance problems.

Most link formats also consistently support the following line and column formats:

- `<file>:<line>`
- `<file>:<line>:<column>`
- `<file> <line>`
- `<file> <line>:<column>`
- `<file>(<line>)`
- `<file>(<line>,<column>)`
- `<file>(<line>, <column>)`
- `<file> (<line>)`
- `<file> (<line>,<column>)`
- `<file> (<line>, <column>)`
- Single quotes or no quotes also work for these:
    - `"<file>",<line>`
    - `"<file>",<line>:<column>`
    - `"<file>", line <line>`
    - `"<file>", line <line>, col <column>`
    - `"<file>", line <line>, column <column>`
    - `"<file>":line <line>`
    - `"<file>":line <line>, col <column>`
    - `"<file>":line <line>, column <column>`
    - `"<file>": line <line>`
    - `"<file>": line <line>, col <column>`
    - `"<file>": line <line>, column <column>`
    - `"<file>" on line <line>`
    - `"<file>" on line <line>, col <column>`
    - `"<file>" on line <line>, column <column>`

### Terminal editor file drag and drop support

Terminal editors now support drag and drop while holding shift to write files to the terminal instead of opening an editor.

![Dragging a file into a terminal editor will show 'Hold Shift to drop into editor'](images/1_75/terminal-dnd.png)

### "Unsafe" profile detection

Detection of the Cygwin shell on Windows was recently removed due to a [security vulnerability](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/160827). This release we bring this back in a safer form and also detect more shell profiles, including Cygwin, Cmder and MSYS2. To mitigate the security problem, before one of these profiles is used it much be configured via the `Select Default Profile` command:

![Select Default Profile is available via the terminal view dropdown or the command palette](images/1_75/terminal-profile-1.png)

![The newly detected profiles appear in a "detected" section at the bottom of the quick pick](images/1_75/terminal-profile-2.png)

When selected, a warning will appear before being added to your settings.json file and acting like a regular profile:

![The notification explains the path is potentially unsafe as it could be modified by another user](images/1_75/terminal-profile-3.png)

This warning can safely be ignored if the computer isn't used by multiple users, for example in a corporate environment.

### Toggleable commands in the terminal view

A long-time request has been to add the Clear Terminal command to the terminal view actions but we have always been concerned about bloat in the UI. Thanks to a new internal feature, we have new hidden-by-default actions that appear in an overflow menu but can be toggled to show via right click:

![Clear terminal, run active file and run selected text are now available in the terminal view's overflow menu](images/1_75/terminal-view-overflow.png)

![Right click one of the view actions to toggle which ones are visible and which go into the overflow menu](images/1_75/terminal-view-toggle.png)

### Ctrl+c drops selection on Windows

Windows shares `kbstyle(Ctrl+C)` between copying a selection and sending `SIGINT` to the shell, depending on whether there is a selection. A common annoyance because of this is that `kbstyle(Ctrl+C)` may or may not send `SIGINT`, for example if you click and make an accidental 1 character selection. To help mitigate this, `kbstyle(Ctrl+C)` to copy the selection will now also clear the selection, so pressing `kbstyle(Ctrl+C)` twice will reliably send `SIGINT` either 1 or 2 times.

### Add a terminal tab stop size setting

There is a new setting `terminal.integrated.tabStopWidth` that configures the tab stop width of the terminal. This is useful when programs output the `\t` character instead of configuring the tab size in their configuration.

### Powerline triangle and diagonal line custom glyphs

GPU-accelerated terminals now get pixel-perfect custom glyphs for the triangle and diagonal line powerline extra symbols glyphs (`U+E0B8-U+E0BF`). These characters are somewhat ambiguous whether they are single or double which characters and differ depending on the font used, we chose to render them as single width.

Before:

![Triangles and diagonal line previously could display with bad anti-aliasing and odd borders](images/1_75/terminal-after-triangle.png)

After:

![Triangles and diagonal line glyphs are drawn pixel perfect](images/1_75/terminal-before-triangle.png)

### Bracketed paste mode used in "Run Selected Text In Active Terminal"

The `Run Selected Text In Active Terminal` command will now run the text using "bracketed paste mode" in supporting shells, so a multi-line selection will be treated as a single input, rather than multiple commands. This makes running actual scripts much more intuitive with less errors occuring.

Before:

![Previously, running two echo statements would be run one after the one with 2 separate prompts](images/1_75/terminal-selected-text-before.png)

After:

![Running two echo statements will now run in a single prompt](images/1_75/terminal-selected-text-after.png)

### Quick fixes for Pwsh Preview feedback providers

PowerShell Preview recently got [a new pluggable feedback provider system](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/18252) which allows printing suggestions when commands fail:

![Running 'gcc' in pwsh preview will present 3 suggestions which VS Code will present as quick fixes](images/1_75/terminal-feedback-provider.png)

We now pull quick fixes from the `[General]` and `[cmd-not-found]` feedback providers, the quick fix dialog can be opened by clicking on the lightbulb or via `kbstyle(Ctrl/Cmd+.)`.

## Source Control

### Git repositories in parent folders

VS Code uses `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` to determine the root of a git repository. In most cases, the root of the git repository is inside the workspace, but there are scenarios in which the root of the git repository is in the parent folders of the workspace or the open file(s). While opening git repositories in parent folders of workspaces or open files is a great feature for advanced users, it can be confusing for new users. We have seen cases in which this confusion resulted in discarding changes from these git repositories resulting in data loss.

To avoid confusion, and to reduce the risk of data loss, starting this milestone VS Code will display a notification and a new welcome view in the "Source Control" view, and will not automatically open git repositories from the parent folders of workspaces and open files.

![Git repository in parent folders](images/1_75/git-repository-in-parent-folders.png)

Clicking on the "Open Repository" button will open a quick pick widget and present a list of all git repositories that were discovered in the parent folders of the workspace or the open file(s). The choice to open a git repository from the parent folders is remembered.

Users can control how git repositories from parent folders are being handled using the `git.openRepositoryInParentFolders` setting. Users who would like to restore the old behavior can set the `git.openRepositoryInParentFolders` setting to `always`.

### Command disablement

Based on the size of a git repository or the presence of various git hooks, some operations can take longer to complete. We have seen in the past that initiating commands while a previous command is still in progress can lead to unexpected results (ex: discard changes on a file while the commit operation is in progress).

To prevent this, we are disabling most git commands while the following operations are in progress: `Checkout`, `Commit`, `Push`, and `Pull`. This means that while these operations are running most git commands will not appear in the Command Palette, and will be disable in the Source Control view and the status bar.

### New Commands

[Git 2.35](https://github.blog/2022-01-24-highlights-from-git-2-35/) introduced a new `--staged` mode for the `git stash` command. This new mode allows you to easily stash only the changes that are staged. If you have a version of git that supports this new mode, you can take advantage of it using the new `Git: Stash Staged` command.

VS Code already had support for deleting a local tag using the `Git: Delete Tag` command. This milestone we enabled the deletion of remote tags using the new `Git: Delete Remote Tag` command.

## Notebooks

<!-- Notebook Overview Ruler show cell editor warning/problems now -->

<!-- Notebook Diff change navigation -->

### Fallback rendering of output to a supported mimetype

Rich outputs in Jupyter Notebooks such as IPyWidgets are visible only during the lifetime of the kernel. Meaning when the notebook is closed and re-opened again, the outputs are no longer visible.
However in a number of these cases, the output can be rendered using a fallback mechanism. For example, an IPyWidget can in some cases (depending on the widget used) be rendered as a static image or HTML content.

As a result, users opening existing notebooks with matplotlib widgets (or similar widgets) can now see the output without having to re-execute the code.

![Notebook Renderer Fallback](images/1_75/notebook-renderer-fallback.png)


## Debugging

### JavaScript debugging

**Improved Node.js Startup Performance**

The 'breakpoint predictor' used for Node.js debugging has been rewritten and improved to dramatically increase speed or large projects. For example, startup time overhead when debugging unit tests in the TypeScript repo was reduced by 62%, and the overhead to debug and start a build in the VS Code repo was reduced by 80%.

If you run into problems breakpoints not being hit, please [file an issue](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-js-debug/issues/new). You can disable the new behavior by setting `"enableTurboSourcemaps": false` in your launch.json, however this option will eventually be removed as we gain confidence.

## Languages

### JavaScript React language label is now JavaScript JSX

The `JavaScript React` language mode has been renamed to `JavaScript JSX` to reflect that JSX syntax is used by more than just React. `TypeScript React` has also been renamed to `TypeScript TSX`.

Note that only the language names shown in the UI have been changed. The internal language ids (`javascriptreact` and `typescriptreact`) remain unchanged for compatibility reasons.

### New shellscript grammar

Thanks to the folks over in https://github.com/jeff-hykin/better-shell-syntax, VS Code now uses a new grammar for shellscript syntax highlighting.

## Contributions to extensions

### Python

#### Auto-select environment when VSCode is launched from an activated terminal

If a user launches VS Code via terminal with a conda or virtual environment already activated, VS Code now detects that and then either auto-selects the environment itself, or asks the user if they would like to make that environment their selected one; depending on the environment.

#### Select requirements files when creating environment

When creating virtual environment using the `Python: Create Environment` command, it finds requirement files in the workspace folder, and allows users to multi-select any number of requirements to install.

#### Select optional dependencies from `pyproject.toml`

Python extension detects and loads the optional dependencies provided in the `[project.optional-dependencies]` part of the `pyproject.toml` file. We use pip editable install command if we detect that the workspace contains a `pyproject.toml` along with any selected optional dependencies.

### Cell editor polish

VS Code can now use all editor line number options when `notebook.lineNumbers` is turned on. For example, with `"notebook.lineNumbers": "on"` and `"editor.lineNumbers": "relative"`, relative line numbers are displayed in cell editor.

### Cell commands

* Join Selected Cells (`notebook.cell.joinSelected`)

### GitHub Copilot

The [GitHub Copilot extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot) is an AI-powered code completion tool that helps you write code faster and smarter. You can use the Copilot extension in VS Code to generate code, or to learn from the code it generates.

GitHub Copilot is now generally available for businesses, with features like license management, organization-wide policy controls, and privacy protections. You can learn more in the [GitHub Copilot for Business announcement](https://github.blog/2022-12-07-github-copilot-is-generally-available-for-businesses/).

We've also added a new [AI topic](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/artificial-intelligence) to the VS Code docs that will help you get started with Copilot.

### Live Preview
#### Setting for External Browser Preview
You can now open the external browser preview in Live Preview in browsers other than your default browser. Using the `livePreview.customExternalBrowser` setting, you can set the external preview to open in:
- Microsoft Edge
- Google Chrome
- Mozilla Firefox
- Your default browser

![Live Preview Custom Browser Setting ](images/1_75/livepreview-custom-browser.png)

#### Setting for the Server Root

You can now set the server's root path to a sub-folder in your workspace. For example, you can ask Live Preview to serve files from your `src` folder in your workspace by setting `livePreview.serverRoot` to `"src"`.

<video src="images/1_75/livepreview-server-root-demo.mp4" placeholder="images/1_75/livepreview-server-root-demo.mp4" autoplay loop controls muted title="Live Preview Server Root Setting Demo">

</video>

## Remote Development

### Remote Tunnels

**Sleep Inhibition**

Remote Tunnels can now prevent the computer from going to sleep on Windows, macOS, and systemd-based Linux systems. This is useful if you leave your desktop to work remotely and want to make sure the tunnel stays accessible. To use this feature:

- When turning on Remote Tunnel Access from the VS Code UI, update the setting `remote.tunnels.access.preventSleep` to `true`.
- When using `code tunnel` on the CLI, pass in a `--no-sleep` flag.

**Reliability Improvements**

Several connection-related issues in Remote Tunnels have been fixed, which should improve reliability.

### Continue Working On

The Continue Working On feature allows you to start in a git repository in a local window and continue working in a remote window like a GitHub codespace.

If you are on a branch that has not yet been published to the remote, you will now automatically be prompted to publish your current branch when you choose to continue working in a different development environment, so that you can access your full branch context elsewhere.

Additionally, you can now continue working on a git repository from a remote window to a local git clone on VS Code Desktop using the `Continue Working in New Local Clone` command.

Finally, all options for continuing your work in a local, remote, or web window are now conveniently surfaced in the remote indicator.

## Preview features

### TypeScript 5.0 support

This update includes support for the upcoming TypeScript 5.0 release. See the [TypeScript 5.0 iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/51362) for more details on what the TypeScript team is currently working on. Some editor tooling highlights:

* New `switch` and `case` completions help you fill in the both of `switch` statements more quickly.
* Work on enabling project wide IntelliSense on github.dev and vscode.dev.

To start using the TypeScript 5.0 nightly builds, install the [TypeScript Nightly](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-typescript-next) extension.

## Extension authoring

### Comment thread state

The `CommentThread` `state` API has been finalized. This API controls whether a comment renders as resolved or unresolved and can affect filtering in the Comments view. You can learn more about how to use the API here: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/127473

## Proposed APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always, we want your feedback. Here are the steps to try out a proposed API:

1. [Find a proposal that you want to try](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/tree/main/src/vscode-dts) and add its name to `package.json#enabledApiProposals`.
1. Use the latest [vscode-dts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vscode-dts) and run `vscode-dts dev`. It will download the corresponding `d.ts` files into your workspace.
1. You can now program against the proposal.

You cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. There may be breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.

### Let notebook renderer fallback to a different mimetype

Sometimes when rendering content, a [notebook render](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/notebook#notebook-renderer) may realize that is cannot render the item properly. Perhaps the renderer requires the kernel to be in a certain state for instance.

Previously for cases like this, the renderer's only option was to render an error message. We've added new proposed API though that let's a renderer throw a specially named error that makes VS Code silently fallback to rendering the other data stored on the notebook output item. An interactive chart renderer for instance could throw this error to fallback to make VS Code render the image data also stored on the current output item.

To trigger this fallback, simply throw an error with the name `vscode.fallbackToNextRenderer` in `renderOutputItem`:

```ts
throw new class extends Error {
    override name = 'vscode.fallbackToNextRenderer';
}();
```

This special error is only meant for cases where rendering is expected to fail in certain situations. If you renderer runs into an unexpected error, it should instead continue to show an error message.

### Quick diff

The quick diff, which is the gutter decoration that shows on added, changed, and deleted lines in the editor, is currently only usable by SCM providers. The proposed quick diff API allows the quick diff to be shows outside of SCM providers. The following example is from the GitHub Pull Request extsion, which uses the quick diff API to show a quick diff for lines changed in a PR:

```ts
vscode.window.registerQuickDiffProvider({ scheme: 'file' }, {
    provideOriginalResource: (uri: vscode.Uri) => {
        const changeNode = this.reviewModel.localFileChanges.find(changeNode => changeNode.changeModel.filePath.toString() === uri.toString());
        if (changeNode) {
            return changeNode.changeModel.parentFilePath;
        }
    }
}, 'GitHub Pull Request', this.repository.rootUri));
```

The full proposal is in https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/45db0a2940c5681dcc717bd973b918751c2b7ad5/src/vscode-dts/vscode.proposed.quickDiffProvider.d.ts.

### Continuous Test Runs

[Continuous test runs](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/134941) allow test extensions to indicate that they're able to watch and re-run tests when changes happen. Supporting this API is a matter of indicating support on your test run profile...

```diff
const profile = controller.createRunProfile('Run', TestRunProfileKind.Run, runHandler);
+profile.supportsContinuousRun = true;
```

And then checking for that in the runHandler:

```diff
const runHandler = (request: TestRunRequest, token: CancellationToken) => {
+   if (request.continuous) {
+       return watchForFileChangesThenRunTests(request, token);
+   }
}
```

The full proposal is in https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/4db912c6c15c667db70aaeb8dfd082e3a0c6a30e/src/vscode-dts/vscode.proposed.testContinuousRun.d.ts.

## Engineering

### Utility Process for Extension Host

The utility process usage for extension host that is required for [process sandboxing](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2022/11/28/vscode-sandbox) is now enabled by default. There is still a setting (`extensions.experimental.useUtilityProcess`), which we will remove soon.

### Performance testing via command line

We introduced node modules that enable a set of performance tests from the command line. This helps us measuring performance regressions quickly. You can run such a performance test with the help of the `vscode-bisect` module. Just run `npx vscode-bisect --help` for how to operate this tool.

### Migrating to ESM

We have embarked a journey to migrate our codebase to ESM. The VS Code project predates native modules (ESM) and we have been using the asynchoronous module system (AMD) for the time being. This has served us well but it is time to move on. We have started to migrate our codebase to ESM, we are making good progress, and hope to finish this effort in the next months.
