## Insiders Release

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the May 1.24 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll see details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the May release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[May Iteration Plan](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/49327)** - See what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit Log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/67?closed=1)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the May milestone.

We really appreciate people taking a look at our new features as soon as they are ready so check back here often and learn what's new to try out.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the VS Code repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues).

## Workbench

## Editor

### Syntax highlighting for deleted lines

VS Code now highlights deleted lines in the inline diff editor:

### Font Zoom actions

Font Zoom actions have been added. They can be invoked in order to increase or decrease the font size of the editor. This is an alternative form of zooming, where the rest of the UI is left as-is.

Use the following keybindings to replace the default zoom actions:

on macOS:

```json
{ "key": "cmd+numpad_add",      "command": "editor.action.fontZoomIn" },
{ "key": "shift+cmd+=",         "command": "editor.action.fontZoomIn" },
{ "key": "cmd+=",               "command": "editor.action.fontZoomIn" },
{ "key": "cmd+numpad_subtract", "command": "editor.action.fontZoomOut" },
{ "key": "shift+cmd+-",         "command": "editor.action.fontZoomOut" },
{ "key": "cmd+-",               "command": "editor.action.fontZoomOut" },
{ "key": "cmd+numpad0",         "command": "editor.action.fontZoomReset" },
{ "key": "cmd+0",               "command": "editor.action.fontZoomReset" },
```

on Windows and Linux:

```json
{ "key": "ctrl+numpad_add",      "command": "editor.action.fontZoomIn" },
{ "key": "shift+ctrl+=",         "command": "editor.action.fontZoomIn" },
{ "key": "ctrl+=",               "command": "editor.action.fontZoomIn" },
{ "key": "ctrl+numpad_subtract", "command": "editor.action.fontZoomOut" },
{ "key": "shift+ctrl+-",         "command": "editor.action.fontZoomOut" },
{ "key": "ctrl+-",               "command": "editor.action.fontZoomOut" },
{ "key": "ctrl+numpad0",         "command": "editor.action.fontZoomReset" },
{ "key": "ctrl+0",               "command": "editor.action.fontZoomReset" },
```

## Extension Authoring

### Custom views

**Access to selected elements**

You can now get the list of currently selected elements in the tree view using the following newly added API to `TreeView`

```typescript
/**
 * Currently selected elements.
 */
readonly selection: ReadonlyArray<T>;
```

**Expand/Collapse listeners**

Following events are added to the `TreeView` to listen to when an element is collapsed or expanded.

```typescript
/**
 * Event that is fired when an element is expanded
 */
readonly onDidExpandElement: Event<TreeViewExpansionEvent<T>>;

/**
 * Event that is fired when an element is collapsed
 */
readonly onDidCollapseElement: Event<TreeViewExpansionEvent<T>>;

export interface TreeViewExpansionEvent<T> {

	/**
	 * Element that is expanded or collapsed.
	 */
	element: T;

}
```

### New Theme Colors

There are two colors for showing a border to the top of a tab:

* `tab.activeBorderTop`: Border to the top of an active tab.
* `tab.unfocusedActiveBorder`: Border to the top of an active tab in an unfocused group.

## Preview Features

Preview features are not ready for release but are functional enough to use. We welcome your early feedback while they are under development.

### Outline View

This release ships with an outline view! While already functional it is still in preview and needs to be enabled manually. Do so by right clicking on the explorer and by selecting 'Outline'.

![Enable Outline](images/1_24/outline-enable.png)

The outline view shows the symbol tree of the currently active editor - for that it relies on information computed by your installed extensions. The outline supports type-to-filter, different sort modes, it can track your cursor, and it supports the usual open gestures, like open to side et al.

![Outline](images/1_24/outline-all.png)

Stay tuned, more work is planned and you can subscribe to issues tagged with the [`outline`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/labels/outline)-label.


### Editor Grid Layout

During this milestone, we began work to implement an editor grid layout feature to allow opening editors vertically and horizontally without limits:

![Grid Editor Layout](images/1_24/grid.gif)

This feature will be available in our [Insiders release](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/) in the beginning of June. Subscribe to [issue 14909](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14909) to receive a notification when this happens.

## Extension Authoring

### Task API

The task API graduated and is now avaiable for all extension authors. It moved from the `vscode.workspace` to the new `vscode.tasks` namespace. We left the old API in `workspace` for one additional month so that extension writers can move to the new API. In addition events got added to signal the start and end of the underlying process bound to a task.

## Notable Changes

* [18233](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/18233): Replace history in Search view
