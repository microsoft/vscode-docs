## Workbench

### Duplicate Workspace in New Window

There is a new command **Duplicate Workspace in New Window** to duplicate the current workspace in a new window. This command can be used as a workaround to the current limitation that one workspace cannot be opened in two windows. The workaround works best when you have the setting `files.autoSave` set to `afterDelay`, `onFocusChange`, or `onWindowChange`. In this way, the editor documents will be synced through the file system when you have the same document open in different windows.

With this addition, we are  **deprecating** the less general command **Open Folder as Workspace in New Window**. We plan to drop support for it in the following milestone.

### Replace term history in Search view

You can now navigate to your previous replace terms in the Search View.

* `kbstyle(Alt+Up)` navigates backward in the history. Corresponding command is `history.showPrevious`.
* `kbstyle(Alt+Down)` navigates forward in the history. Corresponding command is `history.showNext`.

### NPM Script Explorer improvements

Some users want to run an npm script on single click from the Explorer and this is now supported by setting `npm.scriptExplorerAction` to "run". It is also now possible to run a script using the inline actions shown when hovering over a script in the tree. Finally, you can run `npm install` from the context menu when a `package.json` file is selected.

## Editor

### Font Zoom commands

Font zoom commands have been added and they increase or decrease the font size of the editor while the rest of VS Code UI is left as-is. This feature is very handy for presentations and pair-programming.

![font zoom](images/1_24/font-zoom.png)

Use the following keybindings to replace the default global zoom actions:

on macOS:

```json
{ "key": "cmd+numpad_add",      "command": "editor.action.fontZoomIn" },
{ "key": "shift+cmd+=",         "command": "editor.action.fontZoomIn" },
{ "key": "cmd+=",               "command": "editor.action.fontZoomIn" },
{ "key": "cmd+numpad_subtract", "command": "editor.action.fontZoomOut" },
{ "key": "shift+cmd+-",         "command": "editor.action.fontZoomOut" },
{ "key": "cmd+-",               "command": "editor.action.fontZoomOut" },
{ "key": "cmd+numpad0",         "command": "editor.action.fontZoomReset" },
{ "key": "cmd+0",               "command": "editor.action.fontZoomReset" },
```

on Windows and Linux:

```json
{ "key": "ctrl+numpad_add",      "command": "editor.action.fontZoomIn" },
{ "key": "shift+ctrl+=",         "command": "editor.action.fontZoomIn" },
{ "key": "ctrl+=",               "command": "editor.action.fontZoomIn" },
{ "key": "ctrl+numpad_subtract", "command": "editor.action.fontZoomOut" },
{ "key": "shift+ctrl+-",         "command": "editor.action.fontZoomOut" },
{ "key": "ctrl+-",               "command": "editor.action.fontZoomOut" },
{ "key": "ctrl+numpad0",         "command": "editor.action.fontZoomReset" },
{ "key": "ctrl+0",               "command": "editor.action.fontZoomReset" },
```

### Syntax highlighting for deleted lines

VS Code now provides syntax highlighting for deleted lines in the inline diff editor:

![Inline Diff Syntax Highlighting](images/1_24/inline-diff-syntax.png)

### F8 stays in Editor

Last milestone, we changed the `F8` keybinding **Go to Next Problem** to visit all errors and warnings in a workspace. That meant you'd leave the current editor and navigate to other files instead of returning to the top of the current file. Not everyone liked this behavior and so we have added commands to support both:

* **Go to Next/Previous Problem *in Files*** is the default, which visits all problems, and is bound to `F8/Shift+F8`.
* **Go to Next/Previous Problem** which loops inside the current editor.

## Integrated Terminal

### Fallback DOM renderer

Back in the 1.17 release, the Integrated Terminal changed to [rendering using canvas](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2017/10/03/terminal-renderer) in order to boost performance. While this was great for the majority of users, some environments had issues with this at either the hardware and OS levels and rendering ended up taking longer. VS Code now measures the average time it takes to render a frame and if it takes too long, you will get a notification to switch to the new fallback DOM renderer:

![DOM renderer notification](images/1_24/terminal-dom-renderer.png)

This new renderer uses the DOM like the original terminal, so if your environment has issues rendering with canvas, this should provide a more stable experience. You can also turn on the DOM renderer manually with this setting:

```js
{
  "terminal.integrated.rendererType": "dom"
}
```

### Italic support

The terminal now supports the italicized xterm character attribute:

![Italic text within terminal](images/1_24/terminal-italic.png)

### Letter spacing support

A new setting allows increasing terminal letter spacing by an integer pixel value:

```js
{
  "terminal.integrated.letterSpacing": 2
}
```

### Better CLI support in WSL

Running the `code` command line inside the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) will now suppress output and return to the prompt.

### Navigation to split terminals using the `term` Quick Open menu

It's now possible to navigate to specific split terminals via the `term` Quick Open menu:

![terminal Quick Open menu supports splits](images/1_24/terminal-quick-open.png)

## Debugging

### Switch to Debug view on break

It is now possible to automatically switch to the Debug view when a breakpoint is hit. Set the `debug.openDebug` setting to the new value `openOnDebugBreak`.

### New icon for "Continue" action

To better distinguish between the **Start Debugging** and **Continue** actions in the Debug toolbar, we have introduced a new icon for **Continue** that better aligns with the debug icons.

![debug continue](images/1_24/continue.png)

### Renamed "column breakpoints" to "inline breakpoints"

"Column breakpoints" were renamed to "inline breakpoints" because the community is much more familiar with the term "inline breakpoint". Consequently, we are deprecating the old `editor.debug.action.toggleColumnBreakpoint` command in favor of a new `editor.debug.action.toggleInlineBreakpoint` command.

### Call stack shows stack frame's source path

The CALL STACK view now shows the path segments to distinguish sources with the same name easily. A common scenario is having to debug multiple stack frames all named `module.js`.

![callstack](images/1_24/callstack.png)

### Go to next or previous breakpoint

You can now step through all breakpoints using the **Go to Next Breakpoint** and **Go to Previous Breakpoint** commands. The commands step through the breakpoints in different files in the same order as they appear in the BREAKPOINTS view.

### IntelliSense for predefined variables

* **IntelliSense for variables:** We now suggest predefined variables as completions inside string values for both `tasks.json` and `launch.json` configuration files. This should make it easier to use and discover the ever-growing list of predefined variables.

  ![variables](images/1_24/variables.png)

* **Variable substitution for keys:** Previously, we would substitute predefined variables only for values inside `launch.json` and `tasks.json` configurations. With this release, variables are now substituted in keys as well. More about predefined variables can be found [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/variables-reference).

## Languages

### TypeScript 2.9

VS Code now ships with TypeScript 2.9. This update brings new language features such as [import() types](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-2-9/#import-types), [json imports](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-2-9/#json-imports), and many improvements to JSDoc. It also brings some great new tooling support and fixes a number of bugs.

You can read more about what's new in TS 2.9 on the [TypeScript blog](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-2-9/#json-imports).

### Update import paths when a file is moved or renamed

VS Code can now automatically update import paths when a JavaScript or TypeScript file is moved or renamed:

![Updating imports as file are moved and renamed](images/1_24/ts-update-imports.gif)

This feature requires TypeScript 2.9. By default, VS Code will prompt you if we can update paths. You can control the prompting behavior with the `javascript.updateImportsOnFileMove.enabled` and `typescript.updateImportsOnFileMove.enabled` settings.

Valid values are:

* `"prompt"` - The default. Asks if paths should be updated.
* `"always"` - Always automatically update paths.
* `"never"` - Do not update paths automatically and do not prompt.

To make sure all paths are updated as expected, make sure your project includes a [`jsconfig.json`](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/javascript#_javascript-projects-jsconfigjson) or [`tsconfig.json`](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/typescript#_tsconfigjson).

### Highlight unused variables and imports

Unused variables, parameters, and imports are now greyed out in JavaScript and TypeScript:

![Many greyed out unused variables](images/1_24/ts-grey-pre.png)

Use a Quick Fix to remove them and clean up your code automatically:

![Quick fix all action](images/1_24/ts-grey-fix-all-action.png)

After cleanup:

![Source code after the Quick Fix](images/1_24/ts-grey-post.png)

This can be disabled by setting `"javascript.showUnused": false` and `"typescript.showUnused": false`.

### Move to new file refactoring

A new **Move to a new file** refactoring for JavaScript and TypeScript lets you quickly move classes and functions to their own file:

Before:

![Trigger the move the new file refactoring](images/1_24/ts-move-to-file-pre.png)

After:

![After applying the move to new file refactoring](images/1_24/ts-move-to-file-post.png)

### Improved JS/TS auto suggest

IntelliSense is now shown automatically in a few more places. These include:

* After typing a `<` inside jsx code.
* After typing a `/` to close a jsx tag.
* After typing a `'` or `"` for a string literal type in TypeScript.

### Generate getter/setter refactoring

A new **Generate 'get' and 'set' accessors** refactoring lets you quickly encapsulate a field in JavaScript and TypeScript:

Before:

![Triggering generate getter and setter](images/1_24/ts-generate-get-set-pre.png)

After:

![After generating the getter and setter](images/1_24/ts-generate-get-set-post.png)

### Syntax aware folding enabled by default for JS/TS

Syntax aware folding is now enabled by default for JavaScript and TypeScript. A preview of this feature first shipped with VS Code 1.22 but there were a few bugs that we wanted to fix before turning it on for everyone.

The new syntax aware folding should match the old indentation based folding in most cases, however indentation based folding sometimes creates more folding ranges that you may be used to. To revert back to using the old indentation based folding, set:

```json
"[javascript]": {
  "editor.foldingStrategy": "indentation"
},
"[javascriptreact]": {
  "editor.foldingStrategy": "indentation"
},
"[typescript]": {
  "editor.foldingStrategy": "indentation"
},
"[typescriptreact]": {
  "editor.foldingStrategy": "indentation"
}
```

### Preferences for auto imports and generated code

You can now explicitly specify the quote and path styles that VS Code uses for auto imports and other generated JavaScript and TypeScript code.

The new `javascript.preferences.quoteStyle` and `typescript.preferences.quoteStyle` settings specify the type of quotes to use.

Valid values are:

* `"single"` quotes.
* `"double"` quotes.
* `"auto"` to infer quote type from existing imports.

The `javascript.preferences.importModuleSpecifier` and `typescript.preferences.importModuleSpecifier` settings specify the type of path to use for imports.

Valid values are:

* `"relative"` to the file location.
* `"non-relative"` based on the `baseUrl` configured in your `jsconfig.json` / `tsconfig.json`.
* `"auto"` to infer the shortest path type.

These new preferences require TypeScript 2.9+.

### Import folding

Blocks of import statements are now foldable in JavaScript and TypeScript:

![Folding a block of import statements](images/1_24/ts-import-folding.gif)

This feature requires TypeScript 2.9+. You must also have semantic folding enabled (it is enabled by default). Make sure you have `"editor.foldingStrategy"` set to `"auto"` and that you have not set `"typescript.experimental.syntaxFolding": false`.

### SCSS @-keywords completion

Completion for SCSS's [@-Rules and Directives](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#directives) has been added.

![SCSS @-keywords completion](images/1_24/scss-at.gif)

## Preview Features

Preview features are not ready for release but are functional enough to use. We welcome your early feedback while they are under development.

### Outline view

This release ships with an Outline view! While already functional, it is still in preview and needs to be enabled manually. Do so by right clicking on the top Explorer bar and by selecting **Outline**.

![Enable Outline](images/1_24/outline-enable.png)

The Outline view shows the symbol tree of the currently active editor. For symbols, the view relies on information computed by your installed extensions. The outline view includes a filter box, different 'Sort By' modes, optional cursor tracking, and supports the usual open gestures, like Open to Side.

![Outline](images/1_24/outline-all.png)

Stay tuned, more work is planned and you can subscribe to issues tagged with the [`outline`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/labels/outline) label.

### Editor grid layout

During this milestone, we began work to implement an editor grid layout feature to allow opening editors vertically and horizontally without limits:

![Grid Editor Layout](images/1_24/grid.gif)

This feature will be available in our [Insiders release](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/) in the beginning of June. Subscribe to [issue 14909](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14909) to receive a notification when this happens.

### New Settings editor

In this milestone, we began experimenting with a GUI for editing settings, which has been a popular request for a long time. This is an early preview, but if you'd like to try it out, you can open it with the **Preferences: Open Settings (Preview)** command. We would like any feedback you have - you can leave it on [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/50249).

![New Settings Editor](images/1_24/settings-editor.gif)

### Debug toolbar location

In this milestone, we started to work on alternative locations for the Debug toolbar. As a first step, we have introduced a new setting `debug.toolBarLocation` and made an initial attempt at a "docked" Debug toolbar (in addition to the old "floating" toolbar):

![debug toolbar](images/1_24/debug_toolbar.gif)

When docked, the debug actions appear at the top of the Debug view when a debug session starts (and they hide the debug configuration drop down menu).

We are still experimenting with this new toolbar design, so you can expect more changes in the next milestones.

Since the existing `debug.hideActionBar` setting can be easily subsumed under a value `hidden` with the new `debug.toolBarLocation`, we are **deprecating** `debug.hideActionBar`.

## Extension Authoring

### Custom views

**Access to selected elements**

You can get the list of currently selected elements in the tree view using the following newly added API to `TreeView`

```typescript
/**
 * Currently selected elements.
 */
readonly selection: ReadonlyArray<T>;
```

**Expand/Collapse listeners**

The following events were added to the `TreeView` when an element is collapsed or expanded.

```typescript
/**
 * Event that is fired when an element is expanded
 */
readonly onDidExpandElement: Event<TreeViewExpansionEvent<T>>;

/**
 * Event that is fired when an element is collapsed
 */
readonly onDidCollapseElement: Event<TreeViewExpansionEvent<T>>;

export interface TreeViewExpansionEvent<T> {

   /**
    * Element that is expanded or collapsed.
    */
   element: T;

}
```

### Task API

The task API graduated and is now available for all extension authors. It moved from the `vscode.workspace` to the new `vscode.tasks` namespace. We're leaving the old API in `workspace` for one additional milestone so that extension authors have time to move to the new API. In addition, events were added to signal the start and end of the underlying process bound to a task.

### New context key `callStackItemType` for call stack elements

A `callStackItemType` context key has been introduced to control what contextual commands appear for focused items in the CALL STACK view. The following values are available:

* `'stackframe'`: When a stack frame is focused in the CALL STACK view.
* `'thread'`: When a thread is focused in the CALL STACK view. Threads are shown only for multi-thread debugging.
* `'session'`: When a debug session is focused in the CALL STACK view. Debug sessions are only shown if more than one session is active.

### New Theme colors

There are two theme colors for showing a border at the top of a tab:

* `tab.activeBorderTop`: Border to the top of an active tab.
* `tab.unfocusedActiveBorderTop`: Border to the top of an active tab in an unfocused group.
* `list.errorForeground`: The color of items in the Explorer with errors.
* `list.warningForeground`: The color of items in the Explorer with warnings.

### Default argument for keybinding command invocation

It used to be that commands invoked from a keybinding which did not specify any argument list [would receive an empty object `{}` as the only argument](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/42851), when invoked. In the upcoming release, that argument will be `null` instead.

### CodeActionProvider Selection

The `CodeActionProvider.provideCodeAction` method's `range` parameter is now a `Selection | range`. The provided value will always be the user's selection if there is an active editor.

### Webview preserveFocus

The new `preserveFocus` focus flag on `Webview.reveal` allows extensions to show a webview without focusing it. This can be used to open a webview with documentation or other non-interactive content to the side of the current editor.

### Reload webviews inside the webview Dev Tools

You can now press `ctrl+r` or `cmd+r` when focused on a webview's Developer Tools to reload that webview. Keep in mind that this will only reload the webview itself. The `html` value of webview is not changed.

### Access Theme colors in webviews

Extension authors can now access all standard VS Code theme colors inside webviews using CSS variables. These variable names are prefixed with `vscode` and replace the `.` with `-`. For example `editor.foreground` becomes `var(--vscode-editor-foreground)`.

### Tasks and extension authoring

We've noticed that some extensions written in TypeScript are still using the older task version `0.1.0` to compile TypeScript to JavaScript. Task version `2.0.0` has been out for a while and there is a [guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensions/developing-extensions#_compiling-typescript) describing how to update an extension from using task version `0.1.0` to version `2.0.0`.

## Proposed Extension APIs

This milestone we added new proposed extension APIs. We plan to add these APIs to stable in a future milestone once we are confident enough with them. We welcome any feedback on how they work for your extension.

> **Note:** These APIs are still proposed, so in order to use it, you must opt into it by adding a `"enableProposedApi": true` to `package.json` and you'll have to copy the [`vscode.proposed.d.ts`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/vscode.proposed.d.ts) into your extension project. Also be aware that you cannot publish an extension to the Marketplace that uses the `enableProposedApi` attribute.

### Prepare for Outline view

This release ships an [outline view](#outline-view). Currently, there is logic to synthesize a tree from the flat list of document symbols but the logic isn't perfect. We are still discussing the API for this (see [#34968](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34968)) but you can still prepare for this:

* Make sure that your language implementation returns a hierarchy of document symbols (this should be the 'natural' representation anyway).
* Make sure you have two ranges in hand: One that covers the full declaration of a symbol and one that points to the identifier of a symbol (VS Code uses that information to choose the symbol that matches the cursor selection).

Feel free to join the discussion and to propose the API for this: [#34968](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34968).

### Search Provider API

The SearchProvider API lets extensions implement file search and text search in a workspace. It will be especially useful alongside a FileSystemProvider.

```ts
export namespace workspace {
  export function registerSearchProvider(scheme: string, provider: SearchProvider): Disposable;
}

export interface SearchProvider {
  provideFileSearchResults?(options: FileSearchOptions, progress: Progress<string>, token: CancellationToken): Thenable<void>;
  provideTextSearchResults?(query: TextSearchQuery, options: TextSearchOptions, progress: Progress<TextSearchResult>, token: CancellationToken): Thenable<void>;
}
```

To learn more, have a look at the [searchProviderExample](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-extension-samples/blob/roblou/searchProviderExample/fsprovider-sample/src/searchProvider.ts).

## Contributions to Extensions

Our team maintains or contributes to a number of VS Code extensions. Most notably this month:

### Vetur

During this milestone, the [Vetur](https://github.com/vuejs/vetur) Vue.js extension started taking advantage of VS Code's file watcher. As a result:

* Vetur now consumes less CPU / memory usage.
* The new file watching mechanism correctly updates TS/JS files imported in Vue files and provides precise completions.

Meanwhile, Vetur now has End-To-End test coverage and centralized file system access. These changes ensure Vetur's stability and unblocks cross-file and cross-section language features, such as completion for CSS class names in Vue's HTML template or HTML template interpolation.

## Engineering

We moved our [continuous integration builds](https://aka.ms/vscode-builds) over to our friends at [Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/devops/) (👋 shout out to [@chrisrpatterson](https://github.com/chrisrpatterson) & [@lszomoru](https://github.com/lszomoru) for their ongoing support). This was only possible given the DevOps team's work on [public projects](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/vsts-public-projects-limited-preview), as well as several other features. Azure DevOps allows us to have a [single YAML based build definition](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/build/tfs/continuous-build.yml) which targets all our three major platforms: Windows, macOS and Linux.

[![Azure DevOps Builds](images/1_24/vsts.png)](https://aka.ms/vscode-builds)

## New Documentation

### Update Docker topic

We've rewritten [Working with Docker](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/azure/docker) which shows how you can create, publish and reuse Docker containers from within VS Code.

### Working with MongoDB

We've added a new [Working with MongoDB](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/azure/mongodb) topic for managing MongoDB databases in VS Code with the [Cosmos DB](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-cosmosdb) extension.
