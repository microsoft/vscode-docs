## Accessibility

### Terminal accessible buffer improvements

The terminal accessible buffer, which provides screen reader users access to the terminal contents via **Terminal: Focus Accessible Buffer** (`kb(workbench.action.terminal.focusAccessibleBuffer)`) now dynamically updates and remains active until `Escape` or `Tab` are used.

When the accessible buffer is focused in a terminal with shell integration, **Terminal: Navigate Accessible Buffer** (`kb(workbench.action.terminal.navigateAccessibleBuffer)`) enables navigation between terminal commands similar to how editors can be navigated with **Go to Symbol in Editor...**.

### Accept a notification's primary action while keeping current context

To accept a notification's primary action, users have historically needed to navigate to the notification center. **Notifications: Accept Notification Primary Action** (`kb(notification.acceptPrimaryAction')`) runs the primary action without leaving the current context.

## Workbench

### Copy GitHub deeplinks from editor gutter

You can now copy deeplinks for an editor line or range from the editor gutter when working in a GitHub repository. [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev) deeplinks for GitHub repositories are available out of the box.

To access GitHub permalinks and HEAD links from the editor gutter, you can install the [GitHub Pull Requests extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github).

    Sorry, your browser doesn't support HTML 5 video.
</video>

These actions have also been added to the `Share` submenu in the editor tab context menu and explorer context menu.

### Recommend extensions by file content

VS Code can now recommend extensions based on the file content. For example, if you open a Python file that has notebook cells syntax, VS Code recommends the [Jupyter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter) extension that can render and run these cells appropriately.

## Editor

## Terminal

### Improved tab hover

The terminal tab hover now shows the shell's process ID, the full command line and an improved view of extension environment variable contributions.

![Hovering the terminal tab will reveal details about the terminal, this can be triggered with the keyboard via Ctrl/Cmd+K, Ctrl/Cmd+I](images/1_77/terminal-tab-hover.png)

## Source Control

### Git LFS commit support in Remote Repositories

You can now commit LFS-tracked files without installing Git LFS when editing GitHub and Azure Repos repositories. To get started, install the GitHub Repositories or Azure Repos extensions on VS Code Desktop, run the **Open Remote Repository** command to open your repository, and commit your changes using the source control view. The extensions parse your `.gitattributes` configuration to determine whether your changed files should be committed to the repository provider's Git LFS storage.

To disable this behavior, you can set `"githubRepositories.experimental.lfs.write.enabled": false` and `"azureRepos.experimental.lfs.write.enabled": false`. **Note: support for VS Code for the Web is not yet available.**

## Notebooks

### Notebook Find in Output enabled by default

When you open Find control in a notebook, it will now search for text in cell inputs and outputs by default. You can turn this off by changing the options in the filter dropdown.

    Sorry, your browser doesn't support HTML 5 video.
</video>

### Scrollable Output Regions

With `notebook.output.scrolling` set to true, outputs and errors that exceed the `notebook.output.textLineLimit` will render within a scrollable region.

    Sorry, your browser doesn't support HTML 5 video.
</video>

### Format on Save

You can now enable format on save for notebooks. This formats the entire notebook when you save it. You can enable this by setting `notebook.formatOnSave.enabled` to `true`.

## Languages

## VS Code for the Web

### .gitignore support

This milestone we've added support for `.gitignore` files in GitHub and Azure Repos repositories on VS Code for the Web. In the video below, files that are untracked via `.gitignore` are greyed out in the Explorer view and do not appear in the Source Control view. This also works when using the [GitHub Repositories](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.remotehub) or [Azure Repos](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.azure-repos) extensions to remotely browse repositories on VS Code Desktop.

## Remote Development

The [Remote Development extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack), allow you to use a [Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers), remote machine via SSH or [Remote Tunnels](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/tunnels), or the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl) (WSL) as a full-featured development environment.

A Dev Container lets you use a container as a full-featured development environment. The [Dev Container Specification](https://containers.dev/) seeks to find ways to enrich existing formats with common development specific settings, tools, and configuration while still providing a simplified, un-orchestrated single container option. You can learn more about Dev Containers and their spec in a [new episode of the Changelog podcast](https://changelog.com/podcast/529).

You can learn about new extension features and bug fixes in the [Remote Development release notes](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/blob/main/remote-release-notes/v1_77.md).

## Contributions to extensions

### Python

#### Move symbol refactoring

You can now more conveniently refactor your Python code with [Pylance](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.vscode-pylance) thanks to the new **Move symbol to** Code Actions!

To try it out, select a symbol on a Python file and click on the light bulb that is presented (`kb(editor.action.quickFix)`). You can either move the symbol to an existing file or to a new file. If the location is a new file, a Python file is created with the same name as your symbol. All the applicable import references are automatically updated with the symbol move.

</video>

#### Create environment from dependency files

When you open a `requirements.txt` or a `pyproject.toml` file, there's a new **Create Environment...** button in the editor that runs the **Python: Create Environment** command, allowing you to create a new virtual environment and install the listed dependencies.

![A pyproject.toml file open with dependencies listed, and a Create Environment button displayed on the bottom right corner for the editor](images/1_77/create-env-python-dependencies-files.png)

#### Finalized environments API for extension authors

The Python extension's API to work with Python environments available in the user's machine has now been finalized. Extensions can also use it to access the selected environment path that's used by the Python extension to run scripts, or update it to their preferred one.

Example usages can be found in the [Python Environment APIs](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-python/wiki/Python-Environment-APIs#extension-api-usage) wiki page. We are also planning to release an npm types package in the future so it's easier to keep track of any changes in the Python API.

## Preview features

### Notebook search support for outputs

Last iteration, we introduced global search for formatted notebook content in open notebooks, but only for cell and markdown inputs. This iteration, we have added support for searching notebook outputs. When you have a notebook open, there is a toggle that allows you to customize where you would like to search in a notebook. Enable `search.experimental.notebookSearch` to try this out!

## Extension authoring

### Upcoming Electron update may require mandatory changes to native modules

We plan to update to [Electron 22](https://www.electronjs.org/blog/electron-22-0) in our next stable release. This comes with implications for extensions that leverage native modules due to the enablement of the [V8 memory cage](https://www.electronjs.org/blog/v8-memory-cage): `ArrayBuffers` which point to external ("off-heap") memory are no longer allowed. This means that native modules which rely on this functionality in V8 will need to be refactored to continue working in VS Code `1.78` and later.

Please follow the advise in the [Electron Blog post](https://www.electronjs.org/blog/v8-memory-cage#i-want-to-refactor-a-node-native-module-to-support-electron-21-how-do-i-do-that) for how to make your native module work with future versions of VS Code.

## Proposed APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always, we want your feedback. Here are the steps to try out a proposed API:

1. [Find a proposal that you want to try](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/tree/main/src/vscode-dts) and add its name to `package.json#enabledApiProposals`.
1. Use the latest [vscode-dts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vscode-dts) and run `vscode-dts dev`. The command downloads the corresponding `d.ts` files into your workspace.
1. You can now program against the proposal.

You cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. There may be breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.

### Editor gutter proposed context menu

The `editor/lineNumber/context` proposed menu is anchored to the editor gutter and editor line numbers and provides a way to surface extensions actions that are contextual to a particular line.

To try this out in development, enable the `contribEditorLineNumberMenu` API proposal. Actions contributed to this menu receive the line number in command arguments and can reference the `editorLineNumber` context key in their when clauses. You can leave feedback in the [API proposal issue #175945](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/175945).

### Notebook new lifecycle event: onWillSaveNotebookDocument

The `onWillSaveNotebookDocument` event is fired before a notebook document is saved. This event is useful for extensions that want to perform some action before a notebook document is saved. For example, an extension that wants to clean up notebook cell outputs before saving it can register a listener for this event and return the cell output edits to be applied.

Here is how an extension can register a listener for this event:

```ts
vscode.workspace.onWillSaveNotebookDocument(e => {
    if (event.reason == vscode.NotebookDocumentSaveReason.Manual) {
      event.waitUntil(new Promise((resolve) => {
        const notebookEdit = new vscode.NotebookEdit(...);
        const edit = new vscode.WorkspaceEdit();
        edit.set(event.document.uri, [notebookEdit]);
        resolve([edit]);
      }));
    }
});
```
