## Insiders Release

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the August 1.38 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll see details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the August milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[August iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/78844)** - See what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22August+2019%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people taking a look at our new features as soon as they are ready so check back here often and learn what's new to try out.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the [VS Code repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues) on GitHub.

## Workbench

### Link protection for outgoing links

VS Code now shows a prompt before opening outgoing links.

![Link Protection](images/1_38/link-protection.gif)

You can open the link directly or trust specific domains to bypass this prompt. With the **Configure Trusted Domains** button or command, you can enable/disable link protection for specific domains or all outgoing links.

### Maximize editor toggle command

A new command **Toggle Editor Group Sizes** (`workbench.action.toggleEditorWidths`) will toggle between maximizing the active editor group and evening out the editor group widths.

### Hide individual macOS Touch Bar entries

A new setting `keyboard.touchbar.ignored` can selectively remove VS Code commands from the macOS Touch Bar. VS Code adds the following commands by default:

* `workbench.action.navigateBack`
* `workbench.action.navigateForward`
* `workbench.action.debug.start`
* `workbench.action.debug.run`
* `workbench.action.debug.continue`
* `workbench.action.debug.pause`
* `workbench.action.debug.stepOver`
* `workbench.action.debug.stepInto`
* `workbench.action.debug.stepOut`
* `workbench.action.debug.restart`
* `workbench.action.debug.stop`

### Go to Line supports negative line numbers

You can now type in negative line numbers to the **Go to Line** picker to navigate from the end of the file. For example, typing `-1` will reveal the last line of the file.

### New editor group context keys

There are two new when clause contexts for conditionally binding keyboard shortcuts:

* `activeEditorGroupIndex` - A number starting from `1` reflecting the position of an editor group in the editor grid. The group with index `1` will be the first in the top left corner.
* `activeEditorGroupLast` - Will be `true` for the last editor group in the editor grid.

**Note:** See https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings#_when-clause-contexts for a full list of when clause contexts.

### Updated cancel search icon

When running long searches, we've updated the icon used to cancel a search to better represent the action.

![Cancel search icon](images/1_38/cancel-search-icon.png)

### Explorer improvements

#### Top level resource creation

We have improved the process of creation a top level resource in the Explorer. This was particularly tedious if the explorer had many items.
Now there are 3 alternatives how to create file/folder top level in a full explorer view:

* Scrolling beyond the last element in order to invoke the context menu on the empty space
* Pressing Escape clears both focus and selection in the Explorer thus making the title area actions execute on the Explorer root.
* Context menu invoked on the scroll bar

#### Open file and preserve focus

Now it is possible to open the file in preview from the explorer while preserving the focus in the explorer.
The new command is `filesExplorer.openFilePreserveFocus` and by default it can be triggered via the `space` key.

#### explorer.incrementalNaming
We have introduced a new setting `explorer.incrementalNaming` which can have the values `simple` or `smart`.
`Simple` appends the word "copy" at the end of the duplicated name potentially followed by a number. The current vscode stable behavior.
`smart` adds a number at the end of the duplicated name. If some number is already part of the name, tries to increase that number.

### Accessibility improvements

We continue to fix [accessibility issues](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Aaccessibility+milestone%3A%22August+2019%22+is%3Aclosed) in this milestone. Highlights are:
* Word navigation is now complimentary to what NVDA and VoiceOver expect, thus words are properly announced when navigating using word navigation in the editor.
* Windows Magnifier Tool can now follow the cursor in the editor.

## Integrated Terminal

### Improved fallback behavior when using variables in terminal.integrated.cwd

When using variables in the `cwd` such as:

```json
"terminal.integrated.cwd": "${fileDirname}"
```

Instead of throwing an error when a variable cannot be resolved, the terminal will now log an error to the console and fallback to the workspace directory.

### Automation shell setting

In addition to setting the shell for the integrated terminal, you can now specify a shell for automation (such as Tasks). This is particularly useful if you use tmux as your shell since that doesn't work with all automation.

```json
"terminal.integrated.shell.osx": "/Users/user/bin/tmux_script"
"terminal.integrated.automationShell.osx": "bash",
```

## Languages

### Improved Less support

Thanks to a [pull request](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-css-languageservice/pull/135) from Less.js team member [Matthew Dean](https://github.com/matthew-dean), VS Code now supports many new Less.js features including root functions, map lookups and anonymous mixins.

### TypeScript 3.6

VS Code now ships with TypeScript 3.6.2. This major update brings some TypeScript language improvements—including [stricter generators](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-3-6/#stricter-generators) and [support for `import.meta`](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-3-6/#import-meta-support-in-systemjs)—as well as some new tooling features for both JavaScript and TypeScript. As always, this release also includes a number of important bug fixes.

You can read more about the TypeScript 3.6 features on the [TS 3.6 blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-3-6/)

### Add missing await quick fix

<!-- TODO mjbvz -->

### Semicolon aware code edits for JavaScript and TypeScript

<!-- TODO mjbvz -->

### JSDoc comments no longer merge for IntelliSense

Previously, our JavaScript and TypeScript IntelliSense would combine multiple JS Doc comments if they appeared before a definition. In the example below, notice how the documentation for the `User` type is merged with that of the `getUser` function:

![Older TS versions merged multiple JS Doc comments](images/1_38/js-jsdoc-merge-before.png)

With TypeScript 3.6, our IntelliSense now only uses the immediately preceding JSDoc comment for documentation and typing information:

![TS 3.6  only uses the immediately preceding JSDoc comment](images/1_38/js-jsdoc-merge-after.png)

### Smarter Auto-Imports

<!-- TODO mjbvz -->

## Debugging

### Breaking when value changes (aka Data Breakpoints)

From the variables view it is now possible to create data breakpoints that will get hit when the value of the underlying variable changes. Just like other breakpoints, data breakpoints can be disabled/enabled and removed in the breakpoints view.

![data breakpoints](images/1_38/data-breakpoints.png)

Please note that data breakpoints require specific support by an underlying runtime or debugger, and we expect only a few debug extensions like C++ and C# (but not Node.js) to opt-into this feature in the future. For this release only our example debugger [Mock Debug](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=andreweinand.mock-debug) "mocks" data breakpoints.


### Call Stack view improvements

We have done some improvements to the call stack view, most notably:
* When a debug session has just one thread we will always hide the thread and show the call stack directly.
* Clicking on the threads and debug sessions in the call stack view no longer expands / collapses them. Only the explicit click on the twistie will do the expansion.
The reason for this change is that it was very tedious to change the focused session without doing some unwanted expansion. The same behavior can be seen in our Outline view for example.
* Previously when there was a new debug session we would always focus it, now we only focus a session automatically if it breaks.
* Debug session elements only have a twistie rendered when there are actually threads for that session.

### New shell setting for launching a debug target

When launching a debug target in the integrated terminal, we are now respecting the new "shell for automation" setting (`terminal.integrated.automationShell...`).
This setting is useful if you use a specific default shell for the integrated terminal (e.g. `tmux`) that does not work with automation, e.g. when launching a debug target.

```json
"terminal.integrated.shell.osx": "/Users/user/bin/tmux_script"
"terminal.integrated.automationShell.osx": "bash",
```

## Extension authoring

### VS Code Icons Repository

We've published a repository of all of the [VS Code icons](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-icons) for extension authors to leverage. There are dark/light versions of each icon, and we also linked to our [Figma design file](https://www.figma.com/file/7wJdjbq2rKZffZqPdz6OjN/VS-Code-Icons-%E2%80%94-Public?node-id=0%3A1) if you're 😎.


![VS Code Icons](images/1_38/vscode-icons-repo.png)

### Webview.asWebviewUri and Webview.cspSource

We've added two new properties on webviews:

* `Webview.asWebviewUri` - Convert a URI for the local file system to one that can be used inside webviews.

  For desktop VS Code, this will convert `file:` URIs into `vscode-resource:` URIs.

* `Webview.cspSource` - The content security policy source for webview resources.

  For desktop VS Code, this would be the string `vscode-resource:`.

```ts
const panel = vscode.window.createWebviewPanel(CatCodingPanel.viewType, 'Cat Coding', vscode.ViewColumn.One, {
    // Restrict the webview to only loading local content from our extension's `media` directory.
    localResourceRoots: [vscode.Uri.file(path.join(extensionPath, 'media'))]
});

const imagePath = vscode.Uri.file(path.join(extensionPath, 'media'));

panel.html = `<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="default-src 'none'; img-src ${panel.webview.cspSource} https:;">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Cat Coding</title>
</head>
<body>
    <img src="${panel.webview.asWebviewUri(imagePath)}/cat.gif" width="300" />
</body>
</html>`
```

### Development warning for creating webview that don't have a content security policy

While developing an extension that uses the [Webview API](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/webview), we now log a warning when you create a webview that does not set a [Content Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP).

![Debug warning for a webview that lacks a CSP](images/1_38/webview-csp-warning.png)

All webviews (even very simple ones) should set a content security policy. This helps limit the potential impact of content injections and is generally a good measure for defense in depth. We've documented how to add a content security policy to VS Code webviews [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/webview#content-security-policy).

### Machine-specific overridable settings

You can now define a machine specific setting that can be overridable at workspace and folder level using the scope `machine-overridable`.

```json
"configuration": {
  "title": "My Extension Settings",
  "properties": {
   "myextension.libPath": {
      "type": [
        "string",
        "null"
      ],
      "markdownDescription": "Specify the path to the library.",
      "default": null,
      "scope": "machine-overridable"
    }
  }
}
```

### Multi-select in custom tree view

Trees contributed through `createTreeView` can now add the `canSelectMany` option to the `TreeViewOptions<T>`. This enables multi-select in the contributed tree view and causes commands that are run on tree elements to receive all the selected tree elements as an array in the second command argument.

### `markdown.api.render`

<!-- TODO mjbvz -->

## Contributions to extensions

### Helping webview extensions add a content security policy

We've identified a number of extensions that create [Webviews](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/webview) that don't have a [Content Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP). While this does not present an immediate concern, all webview should have a content security policy as a good security best practice. This iteration, we've [started to open issues](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/79340) against these extensions to make them aware of the issue.

If you are interested make some of the extensions you use everyday a bit more secure, take a look over [this issue](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/79340) and submit PRs to help them out.

## Proposed extension APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always we are keen on your feedback. This is what you have to do to try out a proposed API:

* You must use Insiders because proposed APIs change frequently.
* You must have this line in the `package.json` file of your extension: `"enableProposedApi": true`.
* Copy the latest version of the [`vscode.proposed.d.ts`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/vscode.proposed.d.ts) file into your project.

Note that you cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. We may likely make breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.

### Deprecation-tags for symbols and completions

The API for completions, document- and workspace symbols now supports to mark items as deprecated. Completions and symbols have a new, optional property `tags` which is a set of `CompletionItemTag`s or `SymbolTag`s. Today, only deprecation is supported but there plans to add more tags, e.g tags for access modifiers and other modifiers.

The snippet below shows a minimal completion item provider that renders an item that's marked as deprecated.

```ts
vscode.languages.registerCompletionItemProvider('plaintext', {
  provideCompletionItems() {
    const item = new vscode.CompletionItem("deprecated_completion");
    item.tags = [vscode.CompletionItemTag.Deprecated];
    return [item];
  }
});
```

When showing deprecated completions or symbols a strikeout is rendered across the names, items are slighly dimmed, and highlights aren't shown:

![](images/1_38/suggest-deprecated.png)

### Pseudoterminal.onDidClose now accepts a number

The proposed `Pseudoterminal.onDidClose` has changed from an `Event<void>` to an `Event<void | number>`, allowing extension authors to indicate that the terminal or `CustomExecution2` task failed.

## Deprecated proposed terminal APIs removed

The deprecated `TerminalOptions.runInBackground` and `createTerminalRenderer` APIs have been removed. If you need to migrate off of these, you should use `TerminalOptions.hideFromUser` (stable) and `ExtensionTerminalOptions` (proposed) respectively.

## Language Server Protocol

Streaming and work done progress support has been added to the next versions of the language server protocol. Proposed implementations for the [server](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-languageserver-node/blob/master/server/src/proposed.progress.ts#L1) and [client]() are available as `vscode-languageserver@5.3.0-next.10` and `vscode-languageclient@5.3.0-next.9` respectively.


## Debug Adapter Protocol

### Improvements for completion proposals

A debug adapter can now use the new capability `completionTriggerCharacters` for announcing the characters that a frontend UI should use to trigger the completion proposals UI in a REPL or debug console. If none is specified, the frontend UI should use the '.' character to trigger the proposal UI.

In addition we've added an optional `sortText` attribute to the `CompletionItem` type. With this attribute a debug adapter can control how the frontend UI sorts the completion proposals returned by the adapter. If the attribute is missing, the frontend may sort items based on the `label` attribute.

### Fixed a type issue in DAP's JSON schema

In the [JSON schema](https://github.com/microsoft/debug-adapter-protocol/blob/gh-pages/debugAdapterProtocol.json) of the Debug Adapter Protocol we've changed the use of the type specifier `number` to `integer` in those places where a float types makes no sense, e.g. for IDs.
