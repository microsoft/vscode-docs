## Agents

### Agent sessions view improvements

A lot of improvements landed in the agent sessions viewer that lives inside the Chat view:
- resize the sessions list when showing side-by-side
- multi-select to perform operations on multiple sessions
- better stacked view that makes it easy to expand to other sessions and see all filter options

## Chat

### Language Models editor

The Language Models editor received several enhancements this iteration to improve how you manage and configure language models in VS Code.

Model providers can now declare their configuration schema, and VS Code provides the UI for users to enter their configuration. See [Chat Model Provider Configuration](#chat-model-provider-configuration) for details on this new proposed API. Your existing model configurations from the GitHub Copilot Chat extension are automatically migrated.

#### Multiple configurations per provider

You can now create multiple configurations for the same model provider, each with a different API key. This is useful when you want to separate personal and work accounts, or use different API keys for different projects. For example, you might have one Anthropic configuration with your personal API key and another with your team's API key.

<!-- TODO: add screenshot showing multiple Anthropic groups with different configurations -->

#### Configuring models from Azure provider

When configuring Azure models, VS Code opens the `chatLanguageModels.json` configuration file and inserts a snippet template. This snippet includes the required properties such as model ID, name, endpoint URL, and token limits. You can then fill in the values for each model you want to add.

<!-- TODO: add video showing Azure model configuration -->

#### Configuration file

All model configurations are now stored in a dedicated `chatLanguageModels.json` file. You can open this file directly by selecting the file icon in the top-right corner of the Language Models editor. This makes it easy to view, edit, or share your model configurations.

<!-- TODO: add screenshot showing the file icon -->

#### Manage provider groups

You can configure an existing provider group by selecting the configure action, for example to update the API key. You can also remove a provider group entirely by using the remove action.

<!-- TODO: add video showing configure and remove actions -->

#### Additional UI improvements

This iteration also includes several usability improvements:

* **Keyboard access**: Toggle model visibility using keyboard navigation
* **Context menu actions**: Right-click on models to access common actions
* **Multi-selection**: Select multiple models and perform bulk actions like toggling visibility
* **General polish**: The editor is now more robust and responsive

<!-- TODO: add video showing keyboard access, context menu, and multi-selection -->

### Inline chat default model

By default inline chat will now always use the default model of the selected vendor. This is to ensure extensions can provide a specific model that's tailored for the needs of inline chat. User that want to stick to a different model can use `setting(inlineChat.defaultModel)`-setting to control this new behaviour.

### Inline chat UX Preview

We continue to revamp the inline chat experience and have two preview features. An affordance that make it easier to trigger inline chat and a contextual rendering that's lighter and easier to use. Both features can be controlled via these settings: `setting(inlineChat.affordance)` and `setting(inlineChat.renderMode)`.

<video src="images/1_109/inline-chat.mp4" title="Inline chat affordance and contextual input" autoplay loop controls muted></video>

### Embedded terminal improvements

#### Output streaming

Terminal output now automatically expands when a command takes time to execute, giving you immediate visibility into what's happening. Quick commands stay collapsed to reduce visual noise.

<video src="images/1_109/embedded-terminal-streaming.mp4" title="Terminal output auto-expanding for long-running commands." autoplay loop controls muted></video>

#### Interactive input

Embedded terminals are now fully interactive. You can focus the terminal and type directly, which is useful when a command prompts for confirmation or requires user input. The cursor is now visible, making it clear when a terminal is ready for input.

<video src="images/1_109/embedded-terminal-input.mp4" title="Typing input directly into an embedded terminal in chat." autoplay loop controls muted></video>

#### Delete all hidden terminals

The **Hidden Terminals** menu item in the terminal panel now includes a delete icon to clear all hidden terminals in one action.

![Delete icon on Hidden terminals entry in the tabs listt](images/1_109/delete-hidden-terminals.png)

### Parallel dependent task execution

When running tasks via agents, dependent tasks are now processed in parallel instead of sequentially. This can significantly improve build times for projects with multiple independent build steps.

### Auto-expand tool output on failures

The `setting(chat.tools.autoExpandFailures)` setting controls whether tool outputs automatically expand when they fail. This is enabled by default to help you quickly see error details.

### Default model setting for Inline Chat

You can now set a default language model for Inline Chat with the new `setting(inlineChat.defaultModel)` setting. This lets you consistently use your preferred model whenever you start an Inline Chat session, without needing to manually select it each time.

![The Settings editor showing the inlineChat.defaultModel setting with a dropdown list of available language models including GPT-5 mini, Claude, and other options](images/1_109/inline-chat-default-model.png)

### Default model setting for the Implement agent (Experimental)

_Setting: `setting(github.copilot.chat.implementAgent.model)`_

You can now configure a default language model for the "Start Implementation" step during the Plan agent. This setting lets you specify which model the Implement prompt should use for executing plans. Leave the setting empty to use the default model. The model value should be a qualified model name in the format `Model Name (vendor)`, for example `GPT-5 (copilot)` or `Claude Sonnet 4.5 (copilot)`.

![Screenshot showing the Settings editor with the github.copilot.chat.implementAgent.model setting](images/1_109/implement-agent-model-setting.png)

### Agent handoffs support specifying a language model

Agent handoffs now support an optional `model` parameter that lets you specify which language model to use when the handoff executes. This enables you to control the model used for specific agent workflows directly from your `.agent.md` file. The model value should be a qualified model name in the format `Model Name (vendor)`, for example `GPT-5 (copilot)` or `Claude Sonnet 4.5 (copilot)`.

## Accessibility

### Dynamically streamed chat responses and thinking in the accessible view

The accessible view now dynamically streams chat response content as the AI model generates it. Screen reader users can follow the response in real time without needing to manually refresh or reopen the accessible view. This now also includes thinking content, ensuring the screen reader experience directly aligns with the sighted one.

### Stable cursor position in the accessible view

When content updates in the accessible view (such as during streaming chat responses or when using the terminal), the cursor position now remains stable. This prevents focus changes that could disrupt screen reader navigation, letting you read at your own pace while new content is appended.

### ARIA alert for new chat sessions

When a new chat session is created, screen reader users now receive an ARIA alert notification to inform them of the new chat context.

### Improved tool call information in accessible view

Tool calls in the accessible view now include more complete information, making it easier for screen reader users to understand what actions are being performed by AI agents.

### Announce cursor position command

Screen reader users can now quickly access and listen to their current line and column position using the new `Announce Cursor Position` using `kbstyle(Ctrl/Cmd+Alt+Shift+G)`. 


## Editor Experience

### Control editor restoration on startup

A new `workbench.editor.restoreEditors` setting allows you to control whether editors should restore when opening a workspace. When disabled, VS Code starts with a clean editor area instead of reopening the tabs from your previous session. Note that dirty (unsaved) editors always restore regardless of this setting to prevent data loss.

### New experimental themes

We are developing new experimental `VS Code Light` and `VS Code Dark` themes to increase focus and bring a sense of elevation and lightness to the UI, through the use of shadows and transparency. These themes are a work-in-progress - please let us know what works and where we can improve.

![Preview of the new experimental VS Code Dark theme](images/1_109/vscode-dark-experimental-theme.png)

![Preview of the new experimental VS Code Light theme](images/1_109/vscode-light-experimental-theme.png)

## Code Editing


## Notebooks


## Source Control


## Debugging


## Tasks

### Automatic tasks disabled by default

The `task.allowAutomaticTasks` setting now defaults to `off` instead of `on`. This change improves security by preventing tasks defined in `tasks.json` from running automatically when you open a workspace.

To restore the previous behavior, set `task.allowAutomaticTasks` to `on` in your user settings.


## Terminal


## Authentication


## Languages

### Improved shebang language detection

VS Code now has improved shebang language detection support, particularly for files using `/usr/bin/env` with additional flags. Files with shebangs like `#!/usr/bin/env -S deno -A` are now correctly detected as TypeScript. This enables better language support for scripts written in TypeScript using runtimes like Deno or Bun, even without a `.ts` file extension.


## Remote Development

The [Remote Development extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack), allow you to use a [Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers), remote machine via SSH or [Remote Tunnels](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/tunnels), or the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl) (WSL) as a full-featured development environment.

Highlights include:

* TODO: @ntrogh

You can learn more about these features in the [Remote Development release notes](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/blob/main/remote-release-notes/v1_109.md).


## Contributions to extensions


## Extension Authoring


## Proposed APIs

### Chat Model Provider Configuration

We've introduced a new proposed API that enables chat model provider extensions to declare their configuration requirements through the `languageModelChatProviders` contribution point. With this API, VS Code provides a built-in UI for users to enter their configuration (such as API keys and model settings), and passes this configuration to the extension via the API.

This approach will replace the existing `managementCommand` property in future releases. Instead of extensions implementing their own configuration UI through a command, they can now declare their configuration schema and let VS Code handle the user experience.

VS Code provides native UI controls for primitive property types such as `string`, `number`, and `boolean`. For complex types like `array` and `object`, VS Code opens the corresponding configuration file and allows users to enter the configuration directly in the JSON editor with full schema validation and IntelliSense support. See [Language Models editor](#language-models-editor) for details on the configuration experience.

#### Simple configuration

For providers that only need an API key, the configuration is straightforward:

```json
{
  "contributes": {
    "languageModelChatProviders": [
      {
        "vendor": "my-provider",
        "displayName": "My Provider",
        "configuration": {
          "properties": {
            "apiKey": {
              "type": "string",
              "secret": true,
              "description": "API key for My Provider",
              "title": "API Key"
            }
          },
          "required": ["apiKey"]
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

#### Advanced configuration with custom models

For providers that support user-defined models with custom endpoints, you can define a more complex schema:

```json
{
  "contributes": {
    "languageModelChatProviders": [
      {
        "vendor": "my-provider",
        "displayName": "My Provider",
        "configuration": {
          "properties": {
            "apiKey": {
              "type": "string",
              "secret": true,
              "description": "API key for authentication",
              "title": "API Key"
            },
            "models": {
              "type": "array",
              "items": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                  "id": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "description": "Unique model identifier"
                  },
                  "name": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "description": "Display name for the model"
                  },
                  "url": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "description": "Model endpoint URL"
                  },
                  "maxInputTokens": {
                    "type": "number",
                    "description": "Maximum input tokens supported by the model"
                  },
                  "maxOutputTokens": {
                    "type": "number",
                    "description": "Maximum output tokens supported by the model"
                  },
                  "toolCalling": {
                    "type": "boolean",
                    "description": "Whether the model supports tool calling"
                  },
                  "vision": {
                    "type": "boolean",
                    "description": "Whether the model supports vision capabilities"
                  }
                },
                "required": ["id", "name", "url", "maxInputTokens", "maxOutputTokens"]
              }
            }
          },
          "required": ["apiKey"]
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

When registering the language model chat provider, the extension receives the user-provided configuration:

```ts
vscode.lm.registerLanguageModelChatProvider('my-provider', {
  provideLanguageModelResponse: (messages, options, extensionToken, configuration, token) => {
    // configuration contains the values the user entered in VS Code's UI
    const apiKey = configuration.apiKey;
    const models = configuration.models;
    // Use configuration to make API calls...
  }
});
```

The `secret` property in the configuration schema indicates that a field should be stored securely and masked in the UI. VS Code handles secure storage automatically for these fields.

This API is still in proposal stage. You can find the proposal here: [vscode.proposed.lmConfiguration.d.ts](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/main/src/vscode-dts/vscode.proposed.lmConfiguration.d.ts).
