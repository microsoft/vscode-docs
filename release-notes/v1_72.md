# September 2022 (version 1.72)

<!-- DOWNLOAD_LINKS_PLACEHOLDER -->

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the September 1.72 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the September milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/main)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22September+2022%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.

## Workbench

### Ability to disable incremental naming, in file explorer

A new value of `disabled` has been introduced to the `explorer.incrementalNaming` setting. This allows for completely disabling any logic surrounding changing the file name on paste within the explorer. If the file name is already present you will be prompted to overwrite the existing file, similar to most native explorers.

### Built-in preview for some audio and video files

<!-- TODO: mbjvz -->

## Editor

### New Code Action groups

There are two new groups available in the [Code Action control](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_71#_new-code-action-control), `Inline` and `Move`.

These groups correspond to that `refactor.inline` and `refactor.move` Code Action kinds.

### New Code Action colors

You may notice that the [Code Action control](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_71#_new-code-action-control) also looks a little different this iteration. That's because we've tweaked its styling to use better [theme colors](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/theme-color). The biggest change is that the control body now uses `editorWidget.*` colors instead of `menu.*`.

We are still refining these colors, so please let us know if they don't work well with a given theme or if any color customization options are missing.

## Terminal


### Terminal quick fixes

We're starting to roll out a new feature powered by shell integration called quick fixes.

A quick fix is avaialable when a command maps to a set of actions the user will likely take and can be activated via the same keybinding used in the editor `kbstyle(Ctrl+.)` or `kbstyle(Cmd+.)`.

Here are the initial supported quick fixes:

#### Git similar command

When a git command is mistyped, the quick fix suggests the similar command.

![Run: git status is suggested after git sttatus is typed](images/1_72/quick-fix-similar.png)

#### Git set upstream

When `git push` is executed and there's no upstream remote, the quick fix suggests to push with the upstream remote arguments.

![Git push set upstream is suggested](images/1_72/quick-fix-push.png)

#### Git create PR

When a branch is pushed for the first time to the remote, the quick fix suggests to open the link to create a PR.

![An open github PR link action is offered](images/1_72/quick-fix-create-pr.png)


### Shell integration improvements

The following improvements to shell integration were made:

- Run recent command and go to recent directory will now clear the line if it has content (or if it cannot be reliably determined).
- Removed the bash script's usage of the `$PREFIX` environment variable which could conflict with some build tools.
- Polished the zsh script to fix some edge cases around `$ZDOTDIR`.
- Better handling of zsh shell integration on machines that are shared between multiple users.

#### Free port

When a server is launched using a port that is already in use, the quick fix offers an action to kill the process and free the port.

![A server launch fails with a port 3000 in use error. An action to free port 3000 is offered.](images/1_72/quick-fix-free-port.png)

### Hyperlink support

[Hyperlinks sent from the application](https://gist.github.com/egmontkob/eb114294efbcd5adb1944c9f3cb5feda) running in the terminal are now supported. These allow presenting a label that points to a URL and appear with a dashed underline:

TODO: Image

Here's an example of how you could write a link with a label "VS Code" that points to https://code.visualstudio.com/:

```
printf '\e]8;;https://code.visualstudio.com\e\\VS Code\e]8;;\e\\'
```

Or more generally:

```
\x1b]8;; <URL> \x1b\ <Label> \x1b]8;;\x1b\'
```

### VT feature support

This version brings support for these escape sequences:

- `DECRQM`: ANSI and DEC private mode reporting (`CSI Ps $ p`) - This sequence allows programs to query various modes the terminal is in, such as wraparound or bracketed paste modes.
- `DECSCA`: Protection attribute (`CSI Ps " q`) - This attribute determines whether `DECSED` and `DECSEL` can erase content.

### Audio bell

The audio bell works now in the terminal and can be enabled via `terminal.integrated.enableBell`.

## Tasks

### Task completion sound

Tasks play a sound when they finish to enable multi-tasking, improve accessibility, and more.

Configure this via `audioCues.taskEnded`.

### Pin run task entries

Tasks can be pinned in the `Tasks: Run Task` list for faster and easier access.

![Pinned items comprise the top category in the list](images/1_72/pinned-tasks.png)

## Notebooks

### Notebook JavaScript output is now evaluated as a module

JavaScript output in notebooks is now treated as a module. This means that variables declared inside the output will no longer leak into other outputs (and in the case of `const` variables, potentially even prevent other outputs with conflicting variable names from being run).

This also means you can now use `import` inside of JavaScript outputs:

```js
%%javascript
import { myFunction } from './myModules.js';

console.log(myFunction());
```

## Languages

### Markdown link diagnostics

## Remote Development

The Remote Development extensions allow you to use a development container, remote machine, or the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) as a full-featured development environment.

We've heard your feedback about the naming of the **Remote-WSL** and **Remote-Containers** extensions. We intended for `Remote` in their names to indicate you develop in a "remote" or "separate" WSL distro or development container, rather than traditional local development. However, this is a different use of "remote" than many people use, and it could lead to confusion (i.e. is the dev container on my machine?).

Thus, we've updated naming and in-product commands in these extensions to be clearer, renaming them to the [`WSL` extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl) and the [`Dev Containers` extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers). Links such as the extension identifier in the marketplace and documentation remain the same, so you shouldn't see breakage in your current use of these two extensions.

![WSL extension in the marketplace](images/1_72/wsl-extension.png)

![Dev Containers extension in the marketplace](images/1_72/dev-containers-extension.png)

Along with the rename, work continued on features and fixes of these extensions as well. You can learn more in the [Remote Development release notes](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/blob/main/remote-release-notes/v1_72.md).

## Extension Authoring

### Extension debugging in a clean environment

When debugging an extension, there was always the problem that the extension was running in the development environment (user settings and installed extensions) of the author of the extension and not in an environment that was more appropriate for the target user of the extension.

With the recently introduced "profiles" feature it is now possible to run the extension under development in a different environment by specifying a profile in the extension's debug configuration.

Two scenarios are supported:

* **debugging in a clean environment** by using an unnamed "empty" profile that gets automatically deleted when extension debugging has stopped.
* **debugging in a controlled environment** by using a named profile that has been created specifically for the extension under development, and that contains specific user settings and extensions.

This debug configuration shows how to debug in a clean environment:

```json
{
    "name": "Extension",
    "type": "extensionHost",
    "request": "launch",
    "args": [
        "--profile-temp",
        "--extensionDevelopmentPath=${workspaceFolder}"
    ],
    "outFiles": [
        "${workspaceFolder}/dist/**/*.js"
    ],
    "preLaunchTask": "npm: watch"
}
```

And here is a debug configuration for debugging in a controlled environment that uses a previously created profile named "extensionContext":

```json
{
    "name": "Extension",
    "type": "extensionHost",
    "request": "launch",
    "args": [
        "--profile=extensionContext",
        "--extensionDevelopmentPath=${workspaceFolder}"
    ],
    "outFiles": [
        "${workspaceFolder}/dist/**/*.js"
    ],
    "preLaunchTask": "npm: watch"
}
```

Note that when debugging an extension in a remote location (via the [Remote Development](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack) extensions Dev Containers, SSL, or WSL), using the `--profile-temp` flag will result in this status message:

![Disconnected status bar message](images/1_72/remote-status-message.png)

This is expected because the temporary profile does not include any extensions, which means that the Remote Development extensions are missing too. For remote scenarios, it is recommended that you create an empty named profile, add the Remote Development extensions to it, and then use the `--profile=....` command line option.

### Editing notebooks with WorkspaceEdit

Workspace edits can now modify notebooks with `vscode.NotebookEdit`. The `vscode.NotebookEdit` class includes static factory functions for creating edits the insert, replace, and delete cells in a notebook:

```ts
const currentNotebook = vscode.window.activeNotebookEditor?.notebook;
if (currentNotebook) {
  const edit = new vscode.WorkspaceEdit();

  // Use .set to add one or more edits to the notebook
  edit.set(currentNotebook.uri, [
    // Create an edit that inserts one or more cells after the first cell in the notebook
    vscode.NotebookEdit.insertCells(/* index */ 1, [
      // ... new notebook cell data
    ]),

    // Additional notebook edits...
  ]);

  await vscode.workspace.applyEdit(edit);
}
```

### Contributed webview context menus

<!-- TODO: mjbvz -->

### New theme variable for active theme in webviews

The new `data-vscode-theme-id` data attribute in webviews stores the id of the currently active theme. This replaces the now deprecated `data-vscode-theme-name` attribute, which tracked the theme's full name (and which also may have been localized):

```css
body[data-vscode-theme-id="One Dark Pro"] {
    background: hotpink;
}
```

If you were using `data-vscode-theme-name` in your webview, migrate to the new `data-vscode-theme-id` attributed.

### Async notebook renderers

The [notebook renderer API](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/notebook#notebook-renderer) now better support asynchronous notebook renderers. While this was implicitly supported previously, now `renderOutputItem` can return a `Promise` to indicate that the output item is being rendered. The `renderOutputItem` function is now also passed an [`AbortSignal`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortSignal) that is aborted if rendered is canceled

```ts
renderOutputItem(outputItem: OutputItem, element: HTMLElement, signal: AbortSignal): void | Promise<void>;
```

If your renderer performs any asynchronous work, please adopt these API updates so VS Code can better support your renderer.

### Refactor.move code action kind

The new `refactor.move` code action kind can be used for refactorings that move code around (such as moving a symbol to a new file or reordering code within a file).

While extensions could previously create code actions of the kind `refactor.move`, this kind is now officially documented and is [supported by the new Code Action control](#new-code-action-groups).

## Proposed APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always, we want your feedback. Here are the steps to try out a proposed API:

1. [Find a proposal that you want to try](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/tree/main/src/vscode-dts) and add its name to `package.json#enabledApiProposals`.
1. Use the latest [vscode-dts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vscode-dts) and run `vscode-dts dev`. It will download the corresponding `d.ts` files into your workspace.
1. You can now program against the proposal.

You cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. There may be breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.

### Extensible JavaScript notebook renderer

<!-- TODO: mjbvz -->

### Event for env.shell changes

The new event `env.onDidChangeShell` has been added to compliment `env.shell`:

```ts
env.onDidChangeShell(newShell => {
    console.log(newShell); // Same value as env.shell
});
```

## Debug Adapter Protocol

### New 'startDebugging' reverse request

Today VS Code supports multiple concurrent debug sessions but the [Debug Adapter Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol) (DAP) covers only a single session. That means that creating new debug sessions programmatically is not part of DAP and can only be done outside of DAP or the debug adapter, typically in the debug extension that contains the debug adapter. As a consequence multi-session functionality, such as automatically debugging child-processes, is not easily available for non-VS Code DAP clients, because they typically use only the debug adapter and not the VS Code specific debug extension.

To improve this situation, we have added a new reverse request `startDebugging` to DAP that allows to create a new debug session (of the same type as the caller) from **within** the debug adapter. A client capability `supportsStartDebuggingRequest` indicates to a debug adapter that the client supports `startDebugging`.

Please note that in the September release, VS Code does not implement `startDebugging`, nor does the built-in `js-debug` use `startDebugging`.

## Engineering

### Improved startup performance

We reserved engineering time this milestone to improve the startup time it takes from launching VS Code to seeing a blinking cursor in the text editor. We always keep track of our performance numbers and noticed a slight degradation at the end of last milestone that we wanted to address during this milestone.

This was a team effort where everyone was contributing to with various changes throughout the code. A couple of highlights are mentioned here.

#### No more sync fs calls

We typically avoid the synchronous variants of the Node.js `fs` API knowing that these methods will stop script execution until the file system request has been resolved. However in a few cases we were still relying on sync `fs` execution, especially around opening or restoring windows on startup. We were able to change all these calls to their async variants allowing other script to continue running while waiting for the file system request to return.

#### More bundling of main entry points

Our main bundles that make VS Code app are several megabytes in size, bundled as single file using [vscode-loader](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-loader) and minified using [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/). However in some cases we did not invest in bundling, specifically for:

* Our Node.js entry point in the Electron main process that is always getting called first.
* Our bootstrap JavaScript files in the Electron renderer process for opening windows.

Bundling in these two areas allows us to reduce the cost of looking up JavaScript files on startup to just one call for the Electron main process and one call for the window itself.

#### Pushing code to a later phase

The best performance fix is to remove code and never run it, but that is obviously not a solution that is sustainable. An alternative is to simply delay the execution of code to a later phase, for example after the text editor has opened. In this milestone we again reviewed our various components and pushed some of them to a later phase to not block the critical startup path.

### Faster PR checks

For pull requests automatic unit, integration, and smoke-testing is performed. All this happens in parallel but each step requires that our TypeScript-sources are transpiled into JavaScript-code. Originally, we used the TypeScript compiler for this. It emits JavaScript but also does type checking. The latter is time consuming and for testing not really needed. The overall time-cost, by which testing was delayed, was around 5 minutes. We then switched to a custome transpile-only solution that uses the TypeScript compiler-api. This was much faster but still took around 2 minutes.

In this milestone we switched to [SWC (Speedy Web Compiler)](https://swc.rs) which is even faster. It now takes around 12 seconds to transpile all our TypeScript sources. This is a huge improvement and allows us to get feedback on pull requests much faster.

## Notable fixes

* [159862](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/159862) On macOS Catalina, when in full screen mode, the traffic light button display is misaligned
* [161305](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/161305) "Window: Title Bar Style" link doesn't work when viewing other Window settings
* [60821](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/60821) Improved syncing between open recent and the Getting Started page's recent list.
