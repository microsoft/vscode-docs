## Chat

### Plan Mode

A new Plan Mode helps developers break down complex tasks step-by-step before any code is written. Select **Plan** from the agents dropdown in the Chat view to get started. When tackling a multi-step implementation, VS Code prompts you with clarifying questions and generates a detailed implementation plan that you approve first, ensuring all requirements and context are captured upfront.

We recommend spending time iterating on the plan before implementation. You can refine requirements, adjust scope, and address open questions multiple times to build a solid foundation. Once you approve the plan, Copilot implements it either locally in VS Code or via [cloud agents](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-coding-agent), giving you greater control and visibility into the development process. This helps you catch gaps or missing decisions early, reducing rework and improving code quality.

You can also create your own custom plan agent tailored to your team's specific workflow and tools. Use the **Configure Custom Agent** menu to copy the built-in Plan Mode as a starting point, then customize the planning style, tools, and prompts to match your development process. Learn more about [planning in VS Code chat](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/chat-planning) and [creating custom agents](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/custom-agents).

### Agent Sessions

The Agent Sessions view provides a centralized location for managing your active chat sessions, both local in VS Code and sessions created by background agents in other environments, such as [Copilot coding agent](/docs/copilot/copilot-coding-agent.md), [GitHub Copilot CLI](https://github.com/features/copilot/cli/), or [OpenAI's Codex](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=OpenAI.chatgpt). The Agent Sessions view will be enabled by default, and it can be managed via the `setting(chat.agentSessionsViewLocation)` setting.

The Agent Sessions view lists all your active chat sessions organized by their source. The view is divided into sections for local chat sessions in VS Code and for coding agent sessions:

![Screenshot of the Agent Sessions view in the Primary Side Bar, showing a view for local chat sessions, and coding agents like Copilot coding agent, Copilot CLI and Codex.](./images/1_106/agent-sessions-view.png)

You can learn more about the Agent Sessions view in [its new documentation](/docs/copilot/chat/chat-sessions.md/#agent-sessions-view).

#### Cloud Agents

In this release, we have made quite a few updates to cloud agent sessions in the editor.

We migrated the Copilot coding agent integration from the GitHub Pull Request extension and into the Copilot Chat extension to provide a more native cloud agent experience. This paves the way for smoother transitions and interactions between VS Code and [GitHub Misson Control](https://github.com/copilot/agents), such as opening a cloud agent session directly from the Agent Sessions view in the browser and vice versa.

<video src="images/1_106/deeplink.mp4" title="Video showing GitHub Mission Control integration with VS Code." autoplay loop controls muted></video>

#### CLI Agents

In this release, we have also shipped an initial integration with the [Copilot CLI](https://github.com/features/copilot/cli/).

You can create new and resume existing CLI agent sessions in a chat editor or an integrated terminal.

![CLI dropdown](./images/1_106/cli-dropdown.png)

In a CLI agent editor, you can send messages to the Copilot CLI just as you would in a terminal, switch models, and attach context.

![CLI in editor and terminal](./images/1_106/cli-editor-and-terminal.png)

#### Agent Session single view option

The existing setting `setting(chat.agentSessionsViewLocation)` has a new option `single-view` to enable a redesign of the sessions view where all sessions from all providers appear in one list:

<video src="images/1_106/agent-sessions.mp4" title="Video showing new agent sessions view." autoplay loop controls muted></video>

With this design, you can find the agent sessions view right next to the Chat view in the secondary sidebar.

Note that not all functionality from the old view is available in this new view yet. We are actively working on making this new view the default in the near future.

#### Agent delegation

We continue to improve the experience for delegating to cloud agents.

When you use the cloud button to delegate to an agent from the chat panel, you'll be provided a set of available agents to which you can delegate. You can also delegate to the Copilot coding agent from the CLI, via the `/delegate` command in a CLI editor or terminal instance.

![Delegating from a CLI agent editor](./images/1_106/cli-delegate-editor.png)

### Embeddings-Based Tool Selection

In this release we've significantly improved how we filter and group tools for users that have many (over 100) tools enabled in chat. You should see the "Optimizing tool selection..." loading state less often and for a shorter period of time, and also experience improved tool selection with a lower probability of agent confusion.

### Tool auto approval status moved

Auto approval status has moved from being inline inside the chat view to the tool call status/tick icon:

![Hovering a tool's tick icon will reveal why it was auto approved](images/1_106/tool-auto-approve-hover.png)

#### Post-approval for external data

Tools that pull in external data now support post-approval, allowing you to review the data before it's used in your chat session. This helps protect against potential prompt injection attacks.

<video src="images/1_106/post-approval.mp4" autoplay loop controls muted></video>

Post-approval is enabled for the `#fetch` tool and for Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools that declare `openWorldHint`.

#### Server and Extension-Level Tool Trust

You can now trust MCP servers and extension tools at the source level through the **Allow...** dropdown. This means you can approve all tools from a specific MCP server or extension at once, rather than approving each tool individually.

The **Chat: Manage Tool Approval** flow has also been updated to allow you to manage both pre- and post-approval.

![](./images/1_106/manage-tool-approvals.png)

#### CLI agent edit tracking

Chat edit sessions now track edits made by delegated agents, such as the Copilot CLI. When you create sessions from the Agent Sessions view, you can see edits tracked through both inline edit pills and the working set view, making it easier to understand what changes agents are making to your workspace.

### Terminal tool

#### Auto approve parser improvements

Previously sub-command detection in the terminal tool used the naive approach of just splitting on certain strings such as `|` or `&&`. This failed in several ways but the bigger ones were when pipe was used inside strings like `echo "a|b|c"` which would detect the sub-commands `echo`, `b` and `c"`. Another command one is that since we couldn't reliably pull sub-commands, we outright banned paranthesis pairs, curly brace pairs and backticks to be more on the safe side and prevent accidental execution.

This release we integrated a [proper parser](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/) into the feature and use a [powershell grammar](https://github.com/airbus-cert/tree-sitter-powershell) or a [bash grammar](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-bash) for everything else\*. So even really complex cases should correctly be extracted:

![Strings are no longer counted as sub-commands and the new parser also detects $() inside echo calls](images/1_106/tool-terminal-parser.png)

\* _Note that this means it can fail to catch sub-commands when the shell syntax differs from bash, such as `;` in zsh_

#### File write/redirection detection (Experimental)

Thanks to the new parser, we're able to fairly reliably extract files being written to via redirection. There's the new experimental setting `setting(chat.tools.terminal.blockDetectedFileWrites)` that will prevent auto approval conditionally:

![Writing outside the workspace by default will block auto approval](images/1_106/tool-terminal-redirection.png)

#### Disable default auto approve rules (Experimental)

The new experimental setting `setting(chat.tools.terminal.ignoreDefaultAutoApproveRules)` allows disabling the default rules (both allow and deny rules). This is useful if you want more control without needing to look up the defaults.

#### Shell specific prompts and command rewriting

The terminal tool now has shell-specific descriptions for PowerShell, bash, zsh and fish. This should make commands suggested by agent mode more reliable and less likely to fail, especially for PowerShell.

In addition to this, for PowerShell we also re-write `&&` to `;` since the `&&` chain operator is not supported in Windows PowerShell (v5). Note that this is temporarily also happening for PowerShell 7 until [vscode#274548](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/274548) is actioned.

#### Attach terminal commands to chat

You can now attach a terminal command to chat as context from the command decoration's context menu. The attachment shares the command line, captured output, and exit code so the agent understands precisely what happened. This applies to any command tracked by shell integration, making it easy to escalate troubleshooting without copying and pasting text.

![npm i is run in the terminal and the command decoration context menu action Attach to Chat is clicked, which attaches the command to chat](images/1_106/terminal-attachment.mp4)

#### View terminal output inside chat (Experimental)

The new `setting(chat.tools.terminal.outputLocation)` setting controls where the output is displayed. The default `none` value prevents the terminals from cluttering the panel.

Every chat terminal invocation now surfaces two actions on the progress element:

- **Show Terminal** reveals and focuses hidden sessions, and with rich shell integration, scrolls directly to the relevant command. With basic or no shell integration, the action still focuses the correct terminal tab.
- **Show Output** opens the terminal's final output inline within the chat view. The output view expands automatically when a command exits with a non-zero code.

When `npm i` fails, the output is automatically expanded. The terminal is revealed with the **Show Terminal** inline action.

![](images/1_106/terminal-chat-output.mp4)

#### Discover hidden chat terminals (Experimental)

When `setting(chat.tools.terminal.outputLocation):none`, a new **X hidden terminal(s)** button appears in the terminal tabs view when there is at least one hidden chat terminal. It opens a quick pick that lists each chat terminal alongside its chat session so you can immediately focus the right process. The same picker is available from the terminal overflow menu under **View Hidden Chat Terminals**, and it disappears once all chat terminals are visible again.

The agent runs `ls -la`, which succeeds, so the output is collapsed. The **hidden terminal** action is taken from the tabs view and the terminal is selected, revealed, and scrolled to highlight the command.

![](images/1_106/terminal-chat-hidden.mp4)

### Chat view polish

We tweaked some parts of the Chat view to feel more pleasant to use:
- the action to create a new Chat is now a dropdown allowing to create a Chat in the editor or a new window
- the tools and MCP server actions moved right next to the model picker
- the configuration dropdown is cleaned up

![Chat view UX polish](images/1_106/chat-view.png)

#### Edit welcome prompts

You can now right-click on suggested prompts in the Chat welcome view to access additional actions. When you right-click a prompt (or press `kbstyle(Shift+F10)`), a context menu appears with an **Edit Prompt File** option. Select Edit Prompt File to open the prompt file directly in the editor.

Edit Prompt File works with prompts that have an associated file, including user-defined prompts and project-specific prompts configured through the `setting(chat.promptFilesRecommendations)` setting.

![Screenshot of a context menu for a suggested prompt.](images/1_106/welcome-prompt-context.png)

### Auto-opening edited files

We changed the default behavior of the agent to no longer automatically open edited files in an editor. If you prefer the previous behavior, you can enable the setting `setting(accessibility.openChatEditedFiles)`.

### Reasoning in Chat (Experimental)

**Setting**: `setting(chat.agent.thinkingStyle)`, `setting(chat.agent.thinking.collapsedTools)`

Last iteration, we added the `setting(chat.agent.thinkingStyle)` setting which enabled displaying thinking tokens in chat. This is now available in more models! As of this release, GPT-5-Codex, GPT-5, GPT-5 mini, and Gemini 2.5 Pro support this.

The `setting(chat.agent.thinkingStyle)` has been adjusted to 3 more common styles, with `fixedScrolling` as the default which will show the most recent chain of thoughts.

An additional setting, `setting(chat.agent.thinking.collapsedTools)` will add tool calls into the collapsible thinking UI.

![Screenshot showing reasoning tokens displayed in chat with interweaved tool cals and reasoning output. This is the UI with `fixedScrolling` and `readOnly` for the respective thinking settings.](images/1_106/reasoning.png)

### Inline chat v2 (Preview)

**Setting**: `setting(inlineChat.enableV2:true)`

We have ramped up our efforts to modernize inline chat. It's built to be

* single prompt,
* single file,
* and for code changes only

This makes the overall experience much lighter and allows for a simplified UI. For tasks it cannot handle, you'll be automatically upgraded to panel chat.

## MCP

### MCP server access for your organization or enterprise

VS Code now supports MCP registry configured through GitHub organization policies. This allows enterprises to set up a custom MCP registry and control which MCP servers can be installed and started.

When an MCP registry endpoint is configured in your organization's policies, VS Code will:

* Provide browsing and installing of MCP servers from the configured registry
* Restrict starting MCP servers to only those available in the registry when access restriction is enabled

When your organization has configured these policies, the `setting(chat.mcp.gallery.serviceUrl)` setting specifies the MCP registry endpoint URL, and the `setting(chat.mcp.access)` setting controls whether access is restricted to only the servers in that registry. These settings will be marked as "(Managed by organization)" in the Settings editor:

![Screenshot showing MCP settings managed by organization policy, including the Gallery Service URL and Access control settings](images/1_106/mcp-registry-policies.png)

To learn more about configuring MCP server access for your organization or enterprise, see [Configure MCP server access](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/administer-copilot/configure-mcp-server-access).

### Install MCP servers to workspace configuration

When installing MCP servers, you can now choose whether to install them globally or to the workspace configuration. Right-click on an MCP server in the extensions view and select **Install (Workspace)** from the context menu, or use the **Install (Workspace)** action directly in the MCP server editor. This adds the MCP server to the `.vscode/mcp.json` file in your current workspace, making it easier to share MCP servers with your team.

![Screenshot showing the context menu for an MCP server with the Install (Workspace) option highlighted](images/1_106/mcp-install-workspace.png)

### Authentication: Client ID Metadata Document authentication flow

Authentication support for remote MCPs now supports the [Client ID Metadata Document (CIMD)](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-parecki-oauth-client-id-metadata-document-00.html) authentication flow, which is the future standard for OAuth in MCP. This flow enables a more secure and scaleable solution to authentication over [Dynamic Client Registiration (DCR)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7591) because now authorization servers do not have to worry about issueing client IDs per-client.

When connecting to an MCP server that uses an authorization server that supports CIMD, VS Code will automatically use that flow over DCR.

_For more information about CIMD, take a look at [the resources on oauth.net](https://oauth.net/2/client-id-metadata-document/)._

### Authentication: `WWW-Authenticate` scope step up

Authentication support for remote MCPs now supports dynamic scope escalation through the `WWW-Authenticate` header for remote MCP servers. This is called out in [the OAuth 2.0 specification](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750#section-3). This allows MCP servers to request additional permissions when needed, rather than requiring all scopes upfront. For example, connecting to a server might require a minimal set of scopes, but specific tool calls can request broader permissions only when necessary. This provides better security by following the principle of least privilege.

_This is currently called out in the [latest draft of the MCP specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/draft/basic/authorization#scope-selection-strategy) which is expected to be finalized soon._

## Accessibility

### Speech timeout is disabled by default

The configuration `setting(accessibility.voice.speechTimeout)` has changed to be `0` by default. This means, a voice session no longer ends automatically after a certain delay (e.g. a Chat request would not be triggered automatically if you pause). We feel this is a better default experience, but you can always change back to the previous default (`2500`).

### Chat input improvements

The chat input now announces the active mode, agent, and model in a clearer order so screen reader users hear the most relevant context first. The chat accessibility help also calls out that you can press **Delete** to remove attached context items, making attachment management fully keyboard-accessible.


## Editor Experience

### Refreshed iconography

In this release, the codicon icon set has had a facelift. The new icons have been refined with curves, new modifier designs, and more accurate metaphors to make them feel modern, friendly and more legible.

![Product icons have been updated to give them a more modern appearance and increase legibility](images/1_106/refreshed-iconography.png)

### Go to character position

The **Go to Line** command (`kbstyle(Ctrl+G)`) supports navigating to a specific character position in a file using the `::` syntax. This is useful when tools report errors at specific character offsets, such as "error at position 599".

To navigate to a character offset, type `::` followed by the character number in the **Go to Line** input box. For example:

- `::599` - Navigate to character 599 in the file
- `::-100` - Navigate 100 characters from the end of the file

Use the toggle in the input box to switch between 1-based (default) and 0-based offset calculations.

<video src="images/1_106/go-to-line.mp4" title="Video showing editor navigation using Go To Line command." autoplay loop controls muted></video>

### Go to Line improvements

The **Go to Line** command handles out-of-range values more gracefully:

- **Line numbers**: Typing a line number larger than the file's line count navigates to the last line.
- **Column numbers**: Use negative column numbers to navigate from the end of a line. For example, `:12:-1` takes you to the last character on line 12. Typing a column number larger than the length of the line takes you to the end of the line.

These improvements make it easier to quickly jump to the beginning or end of files and lines without knowing exact sizes.

### Copy button for diagnostic hovers

A copy button now appears in diagnostic hovers (errors, warnings, info, and hints) to make copying error messages easier. When you hover over a diagnostic marker, move your mouse over the hover message to reveal a copy button in the top-right corner.

![Hovering over a diagnostic hover reveals a copy button in the top-right corner.](images/1_106/hover-copy-button.png)

### Snooze inline completions from gutter

You can now snooze inline completions directly from the gutter icon. When you hover over the gutter icon, a widget appears with a **Snooze** option. Select it and choose a duration to pause suggestions.

![Screenshot showing the Snooze button in the gutter context menu for inline completions.](images/1_106/nes-snooze.png)

### Find commands faster with accent-insensitive filtering

The Command Palette ignores character accents when searching for commands, making it easier to find what you need regardless of your keyboard layout or language preferences. For example, when searching for a command containing the word `Générer` (French for `Generate`), type `generer` without accents and matching commands appear in the results.

This is helpful when using different keyboard layouts or when mistyping while looking for a command. The filtering is based on [Unicode Normalization Form D](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr15/#Norm_Forms) and supports all Unicode languages.

<video src="images/1_106/filtering.mp4" title="Video showing filtering in Command Palette." autoplay loop controls muted></video>

### Advanced settings

VS Code now supports the concept of advanced settings. These settings are meant for configuring specialized scenarios and are intended for advanced users who need fine-grained control over their environment. By default, advanced settings are hidden in the Settings editor, keeping the interface streamlined while making these powerful options available when needed.

To view and configure advanced settings, select **Advanced** from the filter dropdown menu in the Settings editor, or type `@tag:advanced` in the search box:

![Screenshot showing the Settings editor with the Advanced filter applied, displaying advanced settings with the Advanced tag badge](images/1_106/advanced-settings.png)

When you search for a specific setting by its exact name or use the `@id:` filter, advanced settings will appear in the results even without applying the **Advanced** filter. This ensures you can always find the settings you're looking for when you know what you need.

Advanced settings can be combined with other filters such as `@modified` or `@feature:` to help you find exactly what you need. For example, `@tag:advanced @feature:terminal` shows only advanced settings related to the terminal.

>**Note:** Extension authors can mark their settings as advanced by adding the `advanced` tag to the setting configuration.

## Code Editing

### Folding support in git commit messages

When writing git commit messages in the editor, you can now fold sections of the commit message to keep things organized. To use this feature, enable the `setting(git.verboseCommit)` and `setting(git.useEditorAsCommitInput)` settings.

![Screenshot showing folding nodes in the gutter and a partially collapsed commit message in the editor.](images/1_106/commit-folding.png)

## Notebooks


## Source Control

### Graph incoming/outgoing changes

This milestone we are adding the capacility to easily view incoming/outgoing changes in the Source Control Graph view. For active branches that have incoming/outgoing changes the graph will display an "Incoming Changes" and "Outgoing Changes" nodes. Clicking on each node will display the list of incoming/outgoing files. Users can hide this information in the Graph view using the `setting(scm.graph.showIncomingChanges:false)` and `setting(scm.graph.showOutgoingChanges:false)` settings.

TODO@lszomoru - screenshot

### Graph compare references

### Repositories view selection mode

### Repositories explorer

## Debugging

## Testing

### Navigate uncovered lines in test coverage

When reviewing test coverage, you can now easily navigate between uncovered lines using new navigation commands. Two commands are available in the editor toolbar when viewing coverage information:

* **Go to Next Uncovered Line** - Jumps to the next line that is not covered by tests
* **Go to Previous Uncovered Line** - Jumps to the previous line that is not covered by tests

These commands help you quickly identify coverage gaps and focus on areas that need additional test coverage, making it easier to improve the overall test quality of your codebase.

## Tasks


## Terminal

### Terminal IntelliSense

Terminal IntelliSense has been in the product as an experimental/preview feature [for around 1.5 years](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_89#_vs-codenative-intellisense-for-powershell)! This release we're removing the preview tag and will be doing a staged roll out as the default to all users on stable.

When enabled, typing in the terminal will bring up IntelliSense similar to the editor for PowerShell, bash, zsh and fish:

![Typing "write" in PowerShell will bring up completions starting with the word write](images/1_106/terminal-suggest-write.png)

The completions have various sources, paths for example are all handled by core:

<video src="images/1_106/terminal-suggest-cd.mp4" title="cd presents directories, pressing tab will refresh the entries" autoplay loop controls muted></video>

Some commands feature advanced specifications, like git which has the ability to pull in branch names:

<video src="images/1_106/terminal-suggest-git.mp4" title="git completions support sub-commands, branch names, tags and so on" autoplay loop controls muted></video>

If we learned anything when building this feature it's that no size fits all, so there are many options to tweak the behavior to get what you're after:

- `setting(terminal.integrated.suggest.quickSuggestions)` - Show automatically depending on the content of the command line, as opposed to manually via `kbstyle(Ctrl+Space)`.
- `setting(terminal.integrated.suggest.suggestOnTriggerCharacters)` - Show automatically after a "trigger character" such as `-` or `/`.
- `setting(terminal.integrated.suggest.runOnEnter)` - Optionally run the command when `kbstyle(Enter)` is used (not `kbstyle(Tab)`).
- `setting(terminal.integrated.suggest.windowsExecutableExtensions)` - The list of extensions that are treated as executables on Windows.
- `setting(terminal.integrated.suggest.providers)` - Provides the ability to disable specific providers, for example extensions may contribute completions you don't want.
- `setting(terminal.integrated.suggest.showStatusBar)` - Whether to show the status bar at the bottom of the IntelliSense popup.
- `setting(terminal.integrated.suggest.cdPath)` - Whether to enable `$CDPATH` integration.
- `setting(terminal.integrated.suggest.inlineSuggestion)` - Whether to integrate with shell "ghost text" and how to present it.
- `setting(terminal.integrated.suggest.upArrowNavigatesHistory)` - Whether up arrow is sent to the shell instead of browsing completions, this is particularly useful on zsh where you can filter and then press up to do a history search with that prefix.
- `setting(terminal.integrated.suggest.selectionMode)` - How the Intellisense popup is focused which determines what `kbstyle(Enter)` and `kbstyle(Tab)` do.
- (New!) `setting(terminal.integrated.suggest.insertTrailingSpace)` - Insert a trailing space and re-trigger completions after accepting.

If you are don't see the feature yet, make sure you have [shell integration](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/shell-integration) enabled and enable IntelliSense explicitly in settings via `setting(terminal.integrated.suggest.enabled)`.

Apart from overall polish, this is what else is coming to the feature this release:

- `copilot` and `azd` CLIs now have completions
- The extension API is close to finalization
- Git commit completions show the commit message

![Git commit completions showing branch names and their associated commit messages in the terminal suggest details view](images/1_106/terminal-suggest-commit.png)


### Terminal voice dictation

Pressing `kbstyle(Escape)` now stops a terminal voice dictation session, matching the editor behavior so you can exit dictation without leaving the keyboard.

### Consolidated shell integration timeout setting

We now have one unified configurable setting, `setting(terminal.integrated.shellIntegration.timeout)`, that controls how long VS Code waits for shell integration to become ready before executing commands in the terminal, including those triggered through the executeCommand API and by Copilot terminal tool.

`setting(chat.tools.terminal.shellIntegrationTimeout)` has been deprecated in favor of this consolidation.

## Authentication

### Manage extension account preferences discoverability

The **Manage Extension Account Preferences** command is now more discoverable. In addition to being available in the Command Palette and extension context menus, it now appears in the Account Menu alongside **Manage Language Model Access**. This makes it easier to find and configure which accounts extensions can access.

![Manage Extension Account Preferences in the Account Menu](images/1_106/manageExtensionAccountPref.png)

### Device code flow for Microsoft authentication

Microsoft authentication now supports the device code flow in non-brokered scenarios, particularly useful for remote development environments. When other authentication methods fail, VS Code automatically falls back to device code flow, which displays a code that you can enter on another device to complete authentication.

### Manage accounts command

Manage your authentication accounts directly from the Command Palette using the **Accounts: Manage Accounts** command. This command provides access to account management features when the Account menu is hidden or not easily accessible.

![Manage Accounts Menu](images/1_106/manage-accounts-menu.png)

When you run the **Manage Accounts** command, you'll see a quick pick menu listing all your active accounts. You can select an account to view available actions, including:

- **Manage Trusted Extensions** - Control which extensions can access the selected account
- **Manage Trusted MCP Servers** - Manage MCP server access permissions for accounts that support this capability
- **Sign Out** - Sign out of the account

## Languages

### Python

#### Python Environments Extension: Support for python.poetryPath setting
The Python Environments Extension now respects the existing `python.poetryPath` user setting. This allows you to specify which Poetry executable to use. The provided path will be searched for and selected when managing Poetry environments.

#### Python Environments Extension: Improved venv creation: dev-requirements.txt detection
When creating a new virtual environment, the extension now detects both requirements.txt and dev-requirements.txt files and installs dependencies automatically.

#### Add Copilot Hover Summaries as docstring

You can now add your AI-generated documentation directly into your code as a docstring using the new **Add as docstring** command in Copilot Hover Summaries. When you generate a summary for a function or class, navigate to the symbol definition and hover over it to access the **Add as docstring** command, which inserts the summary below your cursor formatted as a proper docstring.

This streamlines the process of documenting your code, allowing you to quickly enhance readability and maintainability without retyping.

#### Localized Copilot Hover Summaries

GitHub Copilot Hover Summaries inside Pylance now respect your display language within VS Code. When you invoke an AI-generated summary, you'll get strings in the language you've set for your editor, making it easier to understand the generated documentation.

#### Convert wildcard imports Code Action

Wildcard imports (from module import *) are often discouraged in Python because they can clutter your namespace and make it unclear where names come from, reducing code clarity and maintainability.
Pylance now helps you clean up modules that still rely on `from module import *` via a new Code Action. It replaces the wildcard with the explicit symbols, preserving aliases and keeping the import to a single statement. To try it out, you can click on the line with the wildcard import and press `Ctrl+.` (or `Cmd+.` on macOS) to select the **Convert to explicit imports** Code Action.

## Preview Features

### Language Models Editor

A new **Language Models** editor provides a centralized place to view and manage all available language models for GitHub Copilot Chat. You can open it from the chat model picker or via the command **Chat: Manage Language Models**.

>**Note:** This feature is only available in [VS Code Insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/).

![Screenshot showing the Language Models editor with a list of models organized by provider.](images/1_106/language-models-editor.png)

The editor displays:

* All available models organized by provider
* Model capabilities (tools, vision, agent)
* Context size and multiplier information
* Model visibility status

You can search and filter models using:

* Text search with highlighting
* Provider filter: `@provider:"OpenAI"`
* Capability filters: `@capability:tools`, `@capability:vision`, `@capability:agent`
* Visibility filter: `@visible:true/false`

Hover over model names or context sizes to see detailed information including model ID, version, status, and token breakdown.

#### Manage model visibility

Control which models appear in the chat model picker by toggling their visibility with the eye icon next to each model. When a model is visible, it appears in the model picker dropdown when you're using GitHub Copilot Chat, making it available for selection. Hidden models remain in the Language Models editor but won't appear in the model picker, helping you keep your model selection focused on the ones you use most frequently.

![Screenshot showing the eye icon to toggle model visibility with a tooltip displaying "Show in the chat model picker"](images/1_106/toggle-language-model-visibility.png)

This is particularly useful when you have access to many models and want to streamline your workflow by showing only your preferred models in the picker.

#### Add models from installed providers

Use the **Add Models...** button to configure and add models from language model providers you've already installed. When you select this button, you'll see a dropdown list of all installed model providers, such as Copilot, Anthropic, Azure, Google, Groq, Ollama, OpenAI, and others. Select a provider from the list to configure it and start using its models in GitHub Copilot Chat.

![Screenshot showing the Add Models dropdown with a list of installed language model providers including Copilot, Anthropic, Azure, Google, and more](images/1_106/add-language-models-dropdown.png)

This makes it easy to activate additional model providers you've installed without needing to navigate away from the Language Models editor. Access provider management by selecting the gear icon on provider rows.


## Extension Authoring

### ID token in authentication sessions

The `AuthenticationSession` interface now includes an optional `idToken` property. This allows authentication providers to return ID tokens in addition to access tokens, which is particularly useful for scenarios that require user identity information. The Microsoft authentication provider returns this field, while other providers like GitHub may not.

ID tokens contain claims about the authenticated user and are signed by the identity provider, making them useful for verifying user identity. For more information about the difference between ID tokens and access tokens, see https://oauth.net/id-tokens-vs-access-tokens/.

```typescript
export interface AuthenticationSession {
  /**
   * The ID token.
   */
  readonly idToken?: string;
}
```

## Proposed APIs

### Quick Pick and Quick Input improvements

The Quick Pick and Quick Input APIs include several new capabilities that give extension developers more flexibility in creating interactive user interfaces.

<video src="images/1_106/quick-pick-api.mp4" title="Video showing quick pick with prompt, toggle and file icons." autoplay loop controls muted></video>

#### Proposed API: Toggle button support

Extensions can add toggle buttons to Quick Pick and Quick Input interfaces through the `toggles` property on `QuickInput`. This enables scenarios like a password visibility toggle in the input box area, allowing users to interact with controls without leaving the quick pick interface.

Your comments and feedback on this API proposal are appreciated (please refer to the [GitHub issue](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/144956)).

```typescript
export enum QuickInputButtonLocation {
  ...

  /**
   * The button is rendered at the far end inside the input box.
   */
  Input = 3
}

export interface QuickInputButton {
  ...

  /**
   * When present, indicates that the button is a toggle button that can be checked or unchecked.
   *
   * **Note:** This property is currently only applicable to buttons with {@link QuickInputButtonLocation.Input} location.
   * It must be set for such buttons, and the state will be updated when the button is toggled.
   * It cannot be set for buttons with other location values.
   */
  readonly toggle?: { checked: boolean };
}
```

#### Proposed API: Prompt support for Quick Pick

Quick Pick supports a `prompt` property, similar to the one available in Input Box. The prompt displays persistent text beneath the input box that remains visible while users type, providing helpful guidance or instructions that doesn't disappear when the user starts entering text.

Your comments and feedback on this API proposal are appreciated (please refer to the [GitHub issue](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/78335)).

```typescript
export interface QuickPick<T extends QuickPickItem> extends QuickInput {
  /**
   * Optional text that provides instructions or context to the user.
   *
   * The prompt is displayed below the input box and above the list of items.
   */
  prompt: string | undefined;
}

export interface QuickPickOptions {
  /**
   * Optional text that provides instructions or context to the user.
   *
   * The prompt is displayed below the input box and above the list of items.
   */
  prompt?: string;
}
```

#### Proposed API: File icons for Quick Pick items

Quick Pick items can display file-type-specific icons through the `resourceUri` property on `QuickPickItem`. When you provide a resource URI, VS Code automatically derives the appropriate label, description, and icon based on the resource type, matching your current theme's file icon set. This is particularly useful when building file or folder selection interfaces, as users can quickly identify items by their familiar file type icons.

Your comments and feedback on this API proposal are appreciated (please refer to the [GitHub issue](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/59826)).

```typescript
export interface QuickPickItem {
  /**
   * A {@link Uri} representing the resource associated with this item.
   *
   * When set, this property is used to automatically derive several item properties if they are not explicitly provided:
   * - **Label**: Derived from the resource's file name when {@link QuickPickItem.label label} is not provided or is empty.
   * - **Description**: Derived from the resource's path when {@link QuickPickItem.description description} is not provided or is empty.
   * - **Icon**: Derived from the current file icon theme when {@link QuickPickItem.iconPath iconPath} is set to
   *   {@link ThemeIcon.File} or {@link ThemeIcon.Folder}.
   */
  resourceUri?: Uri;
}
```

### GitHub-style alerts in MarkdownStrings ([#209652](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/209652))

We have added support for rendering [GitHub-style alert syntax](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/16925) in `MarkdownString` by setting a new property `supportAlertSyntax`.

```typescript
const markdown = new vscode.MarkdownString();
markdown.supportAlertSyntax = true;
markdown.value = `
> [!NOTE]
> Useful information that users should know, even when skimming content.

> [!TIP]
> Helpful advice for doing things better or more easily.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Key information users need to know to achieve their goal.

> [!WARNING]
> Urgent info that needs immediate user attention to avoid problems.

> [!CAUTION]
> Advises about risks or negative outcomes of certain actions.
`;
```

This enables extensions to render alerts in various places in the UI, such as comments:

![GitHub-style alerts displayed in a comment thread showing each alert type with their respective icons and styling](images/1_106/markdown-alerts.png)

### MarkdownString support in TreeItem labels ([#115365](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/115365))

Extension authors can now use `MarkdownString` in tree view item labels, enabling a subset of Markdown syntax including codicons and text formatting. This allows extensions to create more visually rich tree views.

```typescript
// Codicons
const itemWithIcon = new vscode.TreeItem({ label: new vscode.MarkdownString('$(star) Starred item', true) });

// Text formatting (must surround the entire string)
const italicItem = new vscode.TreeItem({ label: new vscode.MarkdownString('_Italic item_') });

// Formatting and codicons can be combined
const combined = new vscode.TreeItem({ label: new vscode.MarkdownString('_~~**$(check) Done $(star)**~~_', true) });
```

The above items render as:
![Tree view showing three items: a starred item with an icon, an italic item, and a combined item with check and star icons plus bold, italic, and strikethrough formatting](images/1_106/markdown-labels.png)

## Engineering

### Exploration of Automated UX PR testing with Copilot

We've introduced a new automation workflow that helps reviewers understand UI changes in pull requests without manually checking out and running the code. By adding the `~copilot-video-please` label to a pull request with UI changes, an automated process kicks off that:

* Builds VS Code from the PR branch
* Uses GitHub Copilot CLI to interact with the changes and record a video along the way - leveraging [playwright-mcp](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp)
* Generates a Playwright trace for detailed inspection
* Posts the results as a comment on the PR

While it's still early, this workflow can reduce the manual effort required for code review, especially for small UI changes. The videos and traces help reviewers quickly verify that changes work as expected. Currently, the videos are only accessible to team members.

For more details about this automation, see https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/272529.

## Notable fixes
