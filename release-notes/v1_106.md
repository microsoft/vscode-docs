## Chat

### Agent Sessions

The Agent Sessions view provides a centralized location for managing your active chat sessions, both local in VS Code and sessions created by background agents in other environments, such as [Copilot coding agent](/docs/copilot/copilot-coding-agent.md), GitHub Copilot CLI, or OpenAI Codex. The Agent Sessions view will be enabled by default, and it can be managed via the `setting(chat.agentSessionsViewLocation)` setting.

The Agent Sessions view lists all your active chat sessions organized by their source. The view is divided into sections for local chat sessions in VS Code and for coding agent sessions:

![Screenshot of the Agent Sessions view in the Primary Side Bar, showing a view for local chat sessions, and coding agents like Copilot coding agent, Copilot CLI and Codex.](./images/1_106/agent-sessions-view.png)

You can learn more about the Agent Sessions view in [its new documentation](/docs/copilot/chat/chat-sessions.md/#agent-sessions-view).

#### Cloud Agents

In this release, we have made quite a few updates to cloud agent sessions in the editor.

We migrated the Copilot coding agent integration from the GitHub Pull Request extension and into the Copilot Chat extension to provide a more native cloud agent experience. This paves the way for smoother transitions and interactions between VS Code and [GitHub Misson Control](https://github.com/copilot/agents), such as opening a cloud agent session directly from the Agent Sessions view in the browser and vice versa.

<video src="images/1_106/deeplink.mp4" title="Video showing GitHub Mission Control integration with VS Code." autoplay loop controls muted></video>

#### CLI Agents

In this release, we have also shipped an initial integration with the [Copilot CLI](https://github.com/features/copilot/cli/).

You can create new and resume existing CLI agent sessions in a chat editor or an integrated terminal.

![CLI dropdown](./images/1_106/cli-dropdown.png)

In a CLI agent editor, you can send messages to the Copilot CLI just as you would in a terminal, switch models, and attach context.

![CLI in editor and terminal](./images/1_106/cli-editor-and-terminal.png)

#### Agent Session single view option

The existing setting `setting(chat.agentSessionsViewLocation)` has a new option `single-view` to enable a redesign of the sessions view where all sessions from all providers appear in one list:

<video src="images/1_106/agent-sessions.mp4" title="Video showing new agent sessions view." autoplay loop controls muted></video>

With this design, you can find the agent sessions view right next to the Chat view in the secondary sidebar.

Note that not all functionality from the old view is available in this new view yet. We are actively working on making this new view the default in the near future.

#### Agent delegation

We continue to improve the experience for delegating to cloud agents.

When you use the cloud button to delegate to an agent from the chat panel, you'll be provided a set of available agents to which you can delegate. You can also delegate to the Copilot coding agent from the CLI, via the `/delegate` command in a CLI editor or terminal instance.

![Delegating from a CLI agent editor](./images/1_106/cli-delegate-editor.png)

### Embeddings-Based Tool Selection

In this release we've significantly improved how we filter and group tools for users that have many (over 100) tools enabled in chat. You should see the "Optimizing tool selection..." loading state less often and for a shorter period of time, and also experience improved tool selection with a lower probability of agent confusion.

### Tool auto approval status moved

Auto approval status has moved from being inline inside the chat view to the tool call status/tick icon:

![Hovering a tool's tick icon will reveal why it was auto approved](images/1_106/tool-auto-approve-hover.png)

#### Post-approval for external data

Tools that pull in external data now support post-approval, allowing you to review the data before it's used in your chat session. This helps protect against potential prompt injection attacks.

<video src="images/1_106/post-approval.mp4" autoplay loop controls muted></video>

Post-approval is enabled for the `#fetch` tool and for Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools that declare `openWorldHint`.

#### Server and Extension-Level Tool Trust

You can now trust MCP servers and extension tools at the source level through the **Allow...** dropdown. This means you can approve all tools from a specific MCP server or extension at once, rather than approving each tool individually.

The **Chat: Manage Tool Approval** flow has also been updated to allow you to manage both pre- and post-approval.

![](./images/1_106/manage-tool-approvals.png)

#### CLI agent edit tracking

Chat edit sessions now track edits made by delegated agents, such as the Copilot CLI. When you create sessions from the Agent Sessions view, you can see edits tracked through both inline edit pills and the working set view, making it easier to understand what changes agents are making to your workspace.

### Terminal tool

#### Auto approve parser improvements

Previously sub-command detection in the terminal tool used the naive approach of just splitting on certain strings such as `|` or `&&`. This failed in several ways but the bigger ones were when pipe was used inside strings like `echo "a|b|c"` which would detect the sub-commands `echo`, `b` and `c"`. Another command one is that since we couldn't reliably pull sub-commands, we outright banned paranthesis pairs, curly brace pairs and backticks to be more on the safe side and prevent accidental execution.

This release we integrated a [proper parser](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/) into the feature and use a [powershell grammar](https://github.com/airbus-cert/tree-sitter-powershell) or a [bash grammar](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-bash) for everything else\*. So even really complex cases should correctly be extracted:

![Strings are no longer counted as sub-commands and the new parser also detects $() inside echo calls](images/1_106/tool-terminal-parser.png)

\* _Note that this means it can fail to catch sub-commands when the shell syntax differs from bash, such as `;` in zsh_

#### File write/redirection detection (Experimental)

Thanks to the new parser, we're able to fairly reliably extract files being written to via redirection. There's the new experimental setting `setting(chat.tools.terminal.blockDetectedFileWrites)` that will prevent auto approval conditionally:

![Writing outside the workspace by default will block auto approval](images/1_106/tool-terminal-redirection.png)

#### Disable default auto approve rules (Experimental)

The new experimental setting `setting(chat.tools.terminal.ignoreDefaultAutoApproveRules)` allows disabling the default rules (both allow and deny rules). This is useful if you want more control without needing to look up the defaults.

#### Shell specific prompts and command rewriting

The terminal tool now has shell-specific descriptions for PowerShell, bash, zsh and fish. This should make commands suggested by agent mode more reliable and less likely to fail, especially for PowerShell.

In addition to this, for PowerShell we also re-write `&&` to `;` since the `&&` chain operator is not supported in Windows PowerShell (v5). Note that this is temporarily also happening for PowerShell 7 until [vscode#274548](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/274548) is actioned.

#### Attach terminal commands to chat

You can now attach a terminal command to chat as context from the command decoration's context menu. The attachment shares the command line, captured output, and exit code so the agent understands precisely what happened. This applies to any command tracked by shell integration, making it easy to escalate troubleshooting without copying and pasting text.

![npm i is run in the terminal and the command decoration context menu action Attach to Chat is clicked, which attaches the command to chat](images/1_106/terminal-attachment.mp4)

#### View terminal output inside chat (Experimental)

The new `setting(chat.tools.terminal.outputLocation)` setting controls where the output is displayed. The default `none` value prevents the terminals from cluttering the panel.

Every chat terminal invocation now surfaces two actions on the progress element:

- **Show Terminal** reveals and focuses hidden sessions, and with rich shell integration, scrolls directly to the relevant command. With basic or no shell integration, the action still focuses the correct terminal tab.
- **Show Output** opens the terminal's final output inline within the chat view. The output view expands automatically when a command exits with a non-zero code.

When `npm i` fails, the output is automatically expanded. The terminal is revealed with the **Show Terminal** inline action.

![](images/1_106/terminal-chat-output.mp4)

#### Discover hidden chat terminals (Experimental)

When `setting(chat.tools.terminal.outputLocation):none`, a new **X hidden terminal(s)** button appears in the terminal tabs view when there is at least one hidden chat terminal. It opens a quick pick that lists each chat terminal alongside its chat session so you can immediately focus the right process. The same picker is available from the terminal overflow menu under **View Hidden Chat Terminals**, and it disappears once all chat terminals are visible again.

The agent runs `ls -la`, which succeeds, so the output is collapsed. The **hidden terminal** action is taken from the tabs view and the terminal is selected, revealed, and scrolled to highlight the command.

![](images/1_106/terminal-chat-hidden.mp4)

### Chat view polish

We tweaked some parts of the Chat view to feel more pleasant to use:
- the action to create a new Chat is now a dropdown allowing to create a Chat in the editor or a new window
- the tools and MCP server actions moved right next to the model picker
- the configuration dropdown is cleaned up

![Chat view UX polish](images/1_106/chat-view.png)

## MCP


## Accessibility

### Speech timeout is disabled by default

The configuration `setting(accessibility.voice.speechTimeout)` has changed to be `0` by default. This means, a voice session no longer ends automatically after a certain delay (e.g. a Chat request would not be triggered automatically if you pause). We feel this is a better default experience, but you can always change back to the previous default (`2500`).

### Chat input improvements

The chat input now announces the active mode, agent, and model in a clearer order so screen reader users hear the most relevant context first. The chat accessibility help also calls out that you can press **Delete** to remove attached context items, making attachment management fully keyboard-accessible.


## Editor Experience

### Refreshed iconography

In this release, the codicon icon set has had a facelift. The new icons have been refined with curves, new modifier designs, and more accurate metaphors to make them feel modern, friendly and more legible.

![Product icons have been updated to give them a more modern appearance and increase legibility](images/1_106/refreshed-iconography.png)

## Code Editing


## Notebooks


## Source Control

### Graph incoming/outgoing changes

This milestone we are adding the capacility to easily view incoming/outgoing changes in the Source Control Graph view. For active branches that have incoming/outgoing changes the graph will display an "Incoming Changes" and "Outgoing Changes" nodes. Clicking on each node will display the list of incoming/outgoing files. Users can hide this information in the Graph view using the `setting(scm.graph.showIncomingChanges:false)` and `setting(scm.graph.showOutgoingChanges:false)` settings.

### Graph compare references

### Repositories view selection mode

### Repositories explorer

## Debugging

## Testing

### Navigate uncovered lines in test coverage

When reviewing test coverage, you can now easily navigate between uncovered lines using new navigation commands. Two commands are available in the editor toolbar when viewing coverage information:

* **Go to Next Uncovered Line** - Jumps to the next line that is not covered by tests
* **Go to Previous Uncovered Line** - Jumps to the previous line that is not covered by tests

These commands help you quickly identify coverage gaps and focus on areas that need additional test coverage, making it easier to improve the overall test quality of your codebase.

## Tasks


## Terminal

### Terminal IntelliSense

Terminal IntelliSense has been in the product as an experimental/preview feature [for around 1.5 years](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_89#_vs-codenative-intellisense-for-powershell)! This release we're removing the preview tag and will be doing a staged roll out as the default to all users on stable.

When enabled, typing in the terminal will bring up IntelliSense similar to the editor for PowerShell, bash, zsh and fish:

![Typing "write" in PowerShell will bring up completions starting with the word write](images/1_106/terminal-suggest-write.png)

The completions have various sources, paths for example are all handled by core:

<video src="images/1_106/terminal-suggest-cd.mp4" title="cd presents directories, pressing tab will refresh the entries" autoplay loop controls muted></video>

Some commands feature advanced specifications, like git which has the ability to pull in branch names:

<video src="images/1_106/terminal-suggest-git.mp4" title="git completions support sub-commands, branch names, tags and so on" autoplay loop controls muted></video>

If we learned anything when building this feature it's that no size fits all, so there are many options to tweak the behavior to get what you're after:

- `setting(terminal.integrated.suggest.quickSuggestions)` - Show automatically depending on the content of the command line, as opposed to manually via `kbstyle(Ctrl+Space)`.
- `setting(terminal.integrated.suggest.suggestOnTriggerCharacters)` - Show automatically after a "trigger character" such as `-` or `/`.
- `setting(terminal.integrated.suggest.runOnEnter)` - Optionally run the command when `kbstyle(Enter)` is used (not `kbstyle(Tab)`).
- `setting(terminal.integrated.suggest.windowsExecutableExtensions)` - The list of extensions that are treated as executables on Windows.
- `setting(terminal.integrated.suggest.providers)` - Provides the ability to disable specific providers, for example extensions may contribute completions you don't want.
- `setting(terminal.integrated.suggest.showStatusBar)` - Whether to show the status bar at the bottom of the IntelliSense popup.
- `setting(terminal.integrated.suggest.cdPath)` - Whether to enable `$CDPATH` integration.
- `setting(terminal.integrated.suggest.inlineSuggestion)` - Whether to integrate with shell "ghost text" and how to present it.
- `setting(terminal.integrated.suggest.upArrowNavigatesHistory)` - Whether up arrow is sent to the shell instead of browsing completions, this is particularly useful on zsh where you can filter and then press up to do a history search with that prefix.
- `setting(terminal.integrated.suggest.selectionMode)` - How the Intellisense popup is focused which determines what `kbstyle(Enter)` and `kbstyle(Tab)` do.
- (New!) `setting(terminal.integrated.suggest.insertTrailingSpace)` - Insert a trailing space and re-trigger completions after accepting.

If you are don't see the feature yet, make sure you have [shell integration](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/shell-integration) enabled and enable IntelliSense explicitly in settings via `setting(terminal.integrated.suggest.enabled)`.

Apart from overall polish, this is what else is coming to the feature this release:

- `copilot` and `azd` CLIs now have completions
- The extension API is close to finalization
- Git commit completions show the commit message

![Git commit completions showing branch names and their associated commit messages in the terminal suggest details view](images/1_106/terminal-suggest-commit.png)


### Terminal voice dictation

Pressing `kbstyle(Escape)` now stops a terminal voice dictation session, matching the editor behavior so you can exit dictation without leaving the keyboard.

### Consolidated shell integration timeout setting
