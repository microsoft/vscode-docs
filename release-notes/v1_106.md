## Chat

### Tool auto approval status moved

Auto approval status has moved from being inline inside the chat view to the tool call status/tick icon:

![Hovering a tool's tick icon will reveal why it was auto approved](images/1_106/tool-auto-approve-hover.png)

### Terminal tool

#### Auto approve parser improvements

Previously sub-command detection in the terminal tool used the naive approach of just splitting on certain strings such as `|` or `&&`. This failed in several ways but the bigger ones were when pipe was used inside strings like `echo "a|b|c"` which would detect the sub-commands `echo`, `b` and `c"`. Another command one is that since we couldn't reliably pull sub-commands, we outright banned paranthesis pairs, curly brace pairs and backticks to be more on the safe side and prevent accidental execution.

This release we integrated a [proper parser](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/) into the feature and use a [powershell grammar](https://github.com/airbus-cert/tree-sitter-powershell) or a [bash grammar](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-bash) for everything else\*. So even really complex cases should correctly be extracted:

![Strings are no longer counted as sub-commands and the new parser also detects $() inside echo calls](images/1_106/tool-terminal-parser.png)

\* _Note that this means it can fail to catch sub-commands when the shell syntax differs from bash, such as `;` in zsh_

#### File write/redirection detection (Experimental)

Thanks to the new parser, we're able to fairly reliably extract files being written to via redirection. There's the new experimental setting `setting(chat.tools.terminal.blockDetectedFileWrites)` that will prevent auto approval conditionally:

![Writing outside the workspace by default will block auto approval](images/1_106/tool-terminal-redirection.png)

#### Disable default auto approve rules (Experimental)

The new experimental setting `setting(chat.tools.terminal.ignoreDefaultAutoApproveRules)` allows disabling the default rules (both allow and deny rules). This is useful if you want more control without needing to look up the defaults.

#### Shell specific prompts and command rewriting

The terminal tool now has shell-specific descriptions for PowerShell, bash, zsh and fish. This should make commands suggested by agent mode more reliable and less likely to fail, especially for PowerShell.

In addition to this, for PowerShell we also re-write `&&` to `;` since the `&&` chain operator is not supported in Windows PowerShell (v5). Note that this is temporarily also happening for PowerShell 7 until [vscode#274548](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/274548) is actioned.

#### Attach terminal commands to chat

### Refreshed iconography

In this release, the codicon icon set has had a facelift. The new icons have been refined with curves, new modifier designs, and more accurate metaphors to make them feel modern, friendly and more legible.

### Terminal IntelliSense

Terminal IntelliSense has been in the product as an experimental/preview feature [for around 1.5 years](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_89#_vs-codenative-intellisense-for-powershell)! This release we're removing the preview tag and will be doing a staged roll out as the default to all users on stable.

When enabled, typing in the terminal will bring up IntelliSense similar to the editor for PowerShell, bash, zsh and fish:

![Typing "write" in PowerShell will bring up completions starting with the word write](images/1_106/terminal-suggest-write.png)

The completions have various sources, paths for example are all handled by core:

<video src="images/1_106/terminal-suggest-cd.mp4" title="cd presents directories, pressing tab will refresh the entries" autoplay loop controls muted></video>

Some commands feature advanced specifications, like git which has the ability to pull in branch names:

<video src="images/1_106/terminal-suggest-git.mp4" title="git completions support sub-commands, branch names, tags and so on" autoplay loop controls muted></video>

If we learned anything when building this feature it's that no size fits all, so there are many options to tweak the behavior to get what you're after:

- `setting(terminal.integrated.suggest.quickSuggestions)` - Show automatically depending on the content of the command line, as opposed to manually via `kbstyle(Ctrl+Space)`.
- `setting(terminal.integrated.suggest.suggestOnTriggerCharacters)` - Show automatically after a "trigger character" such as `-` or `/`.
- `setting(terminal.integrated.suggest.runOnEnter)` - Optionally run the command when `kbstyle(Enter)` is used (not `kbstyle(Tab)`).
- `setting(terminal.integrated.suggest.windowsExecutableExtensions)` - The list of extensions that are treated as executables on Windows.
- `setting(terminal.integrated.suggest.providers)` - Provides the ability to disable specific providers, for example extensions may contribute completions you don't want.
- `setting(terminal.integrated.suggest.showStatusBar)` - Whether to show the status bar at the bottom of the IntelliSense popup.
- `setting(terminal.integrated.suggest.cdPath)` - Whether to enable `$CDPATH` integration.
- `setting(terminal.integrated.suggest.inlineSuggestion)` - Whether to integrate with shell "ghost text" and how to present it.
- `setting(terminal.integrated.suggest.upArrowNavigatesHistory)` - Whether up arrow is sent to the shell instead of browsing completions, this is particularly useful on zsh where you can filter and then press up to do a history search with that prefix.
- `setting(terminal.integrated.suggest.selectionMode)` - How the Intellisense popup is focused which determines what `kbstyle(Enter)` and `kbstyle(Tab)` do.
- (New!) `setting(terminal.integrated.suggest.insertTrailingSpace)` - Insert a trailing space and re-trigger completions after accepting.

If you are don't see the feature yet, make sure you have [shell integration](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/shell-integration) enabled and enable IntelliSense explicitly in settings via `setting(terminal.integrated.suggest.enabled)`.

Apart from overall polish, this is what else is coming to the feature this release:

- Git commit completions show the commit message
- `copilot` and `azd` CLIs now have completions
- The extension API is finalized

### Consolidated shell integration timeout setting

## Languages


## Remote Development

The [Remote Development extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack), allow you to use a [Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers), remote machine via SSH or [Remote Tunnels](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/tunnels), or the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl) (WSL) as a full-featured development environment.

Highlights include:

* TODO: @ntrogh

You can learn more about these features in the [Remote Development release notes](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/blob/main/remote-release-notes/v1_106.md).
