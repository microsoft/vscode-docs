### Refreshed iconography

In this release, the codicon icon set has had a facelift. The new icons have been refined with curves, new modifier designs, and more accurate metaphors to make them feel modern, friendly and more legible.

### Terminal IntelliSense

Terminal IntelliSense has been in the product as an experimental/preview feature [for around 1.5 years](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_89#_vs-codenative-intellisense-for-powershell)! This release we're removing the preview tag and will be doing a staged roll out as the default to all users on stable.

When enabled, typing in the terminal will bring up IntelliSense similar to the editor for pwsh, bash, zsh and fish:

![Typing "write" in pwsh will bring up completions starting with the word write](images/1_106/terminal-suggest-write.png)

The completions have various sources, paths for example are all handled by core:

<video src="images/1_106/terminal-suggest-cd.mp4" title="cd presents directories, pressing tab will refresh the entries" autoplay loop controls muted></video>

Some commands feature advanced specifications, like git which has the ability to pull in branch names:

<video src="images/1_106/terminal-suggest-git.mp4" title="git completions support sub-commands, branch names, tags and so on" autoplay loop controls muted></video>

If we learned anything when building this feature it's that no size fits all, so there are many options to tweak the behavior to get what you're after:

- `setting(terminal.integrated.suggest.quickSuggestions)` - Show automatically depending on the content of the command line, as opposed to manually via `kbstyle(Ctrl+Space)`.
- `setting(terminal.integrated.suggest.suggestOnTriggerCharacters)` - Show automatically after a "trigger character" such as `-` or `/`.
- `setting(terminal.integrated.suggest.runOnEnter)` - Optionally run the command when `kbstyle(Enter)` is used (not `kbstyle(Tab)`).
- `setting(terminal.integrated.suggest.windowsExecutableExtensions)` - The list of extensions that are treated as executables on Windows.
- `setting(terminal.integrated.suggest.providers)` - Provides the ability to disable specific providers, for example extensions may contribute completions you don't want.
- `setting(terminal.integrated.suggest.showStatusBar)` - Whether to show the status bar at the bottom of the IntelliSense popup.
- `setting(terminal.integrated.suggest.cdPath)` - Whether to enable `$CDPATH` integration.
- `setting(terminal.integrated.suggest.inlineSuggestion)` - Whether to integrate with shell "ghost text" and how to present it.
- `setting(terminal.integrated.suggest.upArrowNavigatesHistory)` - Whether up arrow is sent to the shell instead of browsing completions, this is particularly useful on zsh where you can filter and then press up to do a history search with that prefix.
- `setting(terminal.integrated.suggest.selectionMode)` - How the Intellisense popup is focused which determines what `kbstyle(Enter)` and `kbstyle(Tab)` do.
- (New!) `setting(terminal.integrated.suggest.insertTrailingSpace)` - Insert a trailing space and re-trigger completions after accepting.

If you are don't see the feature yet, make sure you have [shell integration](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/shell-integration) enabled and enable IntelliSense explicitly in settings via `setting(terminal.integrated.suggest.enabled)`.

## Languages


## Remote Development

The [Remote Development extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack), allow you to use a [Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers), remote machine via SSH or [Remote Tunnels](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/tunnels), or the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl) (WSL) as a full-featured development environment.
