## Chat

### Google sign in

The option to sign in or sign up to GitHub Copilot with a Google account is now generally available and rolling out to all users in VS Code.

![Screenshot showing the sign in dialog showing the option to use a Google account.](images/1_104/google.png)

You can find more information about this in the [related GitHub blog](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-07-15-social-login-with-google-is-now-generally-available).

### Configure Chat view default visibility

**Setting**: `setting(workbench.secondarySideBar.defaultVisibility)`

When you open a workspace for the first time, the Secondary Side Bar is visible by default, inviting you to ask questions or start an agentic session right away. You can configure this behavior with the `setting(workbench.secondarySideBar.defaultVisibility)` setting or by using the dropdown of the Chat view itself:

![Screenshot showing Chat view menu with the option to set the default Secondary Side Bar visibility.](images/1_104/auxview.png)

### Setting to hide and disable GitHub Copilot AI features

**Setting**: `setting(chat.disableAIFeatures)`

We are introducing a new setting `setting(chat.disableAIFeatures)` for disabling and hiding built-in AI features provided by GitHub Copilot, including chat, code completions and next edit suggestions.

The setting has the following advantages over the previous solution we had in place:

* Syncs across your devices unless you disable this explicitly
* Disables the Copilot extensions in case they are installed
* Configure the setting per-profile or per-workspace, making it easy to disable AI features selectively

The command to "Hide AI Features" was renamed to reflect this change and will now reveal this new setting in the settings editor:

![Learn how to hide AI Features](images/1_104/hideai.png)

> **Note**: users that were hiding AI features previously will continue to see AI features hidden. You can update the setting in addition if you want to synchronize your choice across devices.

### Configure chat content font family and size

**Settings**: `setting(chat.fontFamily)`, `setting(chat.fontSize)`

To help improve the readability of chat messages, we have added two new settings that allow users to customize the font family (`setting(chat.fontFamily)`) and font size (`setting(chat.fontSize)`) of the chat messages. Note that content displayed in a list does not yet honor these settings, but this is something that we are working on fixing in the upcoming releases.

### Terminal auto approve

#### UI entry point

Terminal auto approve now has a dedicated UI entry point that allows conveniently adding rules based on the command being run. This provides three standard options that may differ depending on the context:

* Approve the sub-command(s) - for `foo --arg && bar` this would add rules `"foo"` and `"bar"`, allowing those 2 commands with any arguments.
* Approve the exact command line - for  `foo --arg && bar` this would add the rule  `"/^foo --arg && bar$/`.
* Configure auto approve which opens settings.

![Screenshot that shows the three standard options are presented for "foo --arg && bar".](images/1_104/terminal-auto-approve-ui.png)

_Theme: [Sapphire](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Tyriar.theme-sapphire) (preview on [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev/editor/theme/Tyriar.theme-sapphire))_

This has some basic support for commands to suggest sub-commands where they would be more appropriate, such as suggesting a `npm test` rule rather than `npm`.

#### Reasoning

One of the problems with auto approve had been the lack of transparency around what rules are doing what. Last version we added the ability to see this reasoning in the log files, but we now surface this right in the UI.

![When git show was run it shows under the tool call that it was approved by the rule "git show"](images/1_104/terminal-auto-approve-reasoning.png)

This doesn't just show the rules, but are also links directly to the relevant settings (user, remote, workspace). Freshly added rules will also show immediately for improved transparency and give the user the ability to easily undo the addition if needed.

![Adding new rules will show under the tool call that they were just added with links to action them](images/1_104/terminal-auto-approve-new-links.png)

#### New defaults

A set of default commands are being added which approves a pretty significant number of commands automatically. You can see the full list of rules by viewing the setting's default value by opening your `settings.json` file, then entering `chat.tools.terminal.autoApprove` and completing it via `kbstyle(Tab)`.

These defaults aim to provide a good amount of safety and reduce the amount of noise, so that you can focus on the approvals that actually matter. A good example of these defaults providing additional safety is that the average user may go ahead and auto approve all `find` commands assuming it was safe, unbeknownst to them that there are several arguments that allow execution of arbitrary commands such as `-exec` or `-ok`. We handle these edge cases in the defaults, where we allow `find` but only when one of these dangerous arguments isn't used.

#### New rule capabilities

Non-regex rules that contain a backslash or forward slash character are now treated as a path and not only approve that exact path, but also allow either slash type and also a `./` prefix. So a rule of `"scripts/test.sh"` will allow:

* `scripts/test.sh`
* `scripts\test.sh`
* `./scripts/test.sh`
* `.\scripts\test.sh`

Additionally, when the shell is PowerShell, all rules are forced to be case insensitive to align with how that shell works.

#### Opt-in warning

Auto approval for the terminal tool is very powerful and helps streamline agent interactions. To better educate about the risks of enabling these auto approvals, especially when custom rules are added, you must now opt in via the dropdown before any terminal commands are auto approved.

![Before terminal auto approve starts working you must enable it via the Allow dropdown](images/1_104/terminal-auto-approve-opt-in.png)

![When the enable entry is used, a dialog will appear and warn you about ](images/1_104/terminal-auto-approve-opt-in2.png)

The link goes to the [Security documentation article](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/security) that provides more detail on the considerations of AI-powered development.

#### Global toggle with policy support

There is a new setting `setting(chat.tools.terminal.enableAutoApprove)` that enables you to force the terminal auto approve setting off. This can also be controlled by group policy when tightening of security is necessary.

### Terminal tool warning for curl and similar commands

Pulling context from the internet is the most common vector for prompt injection attacks. Therefore, when agent mode wants to execute `curl`, `wget`, `Invoke-RestMethod`, and `Invoke-WebRequest`, we show a warning message to inform about the risk of prompt injection.

![These commands will show the warning "Web content may contain malicious code or attempt prompt injection attacks."](images/1_104/terminal-tool-curl.png)

### More terminal tools to core

Like [the `runInTerminal` tool last release](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_103#_improved-reliability-and-performance-of-the-run-in-terminal-and-task-tools), the `terminalSelection` and `terminalLastCommand` tools have been moved from the extension to core which should provide general reliability improvements.


### Input request detection for terminals and tasks

When you run a task or terminal command in agent mode, the agent now detects when the process requests user input. You will be prompted to respond in chat, with the default or first option surfaced as the primary action and other options available in a dropdown. This works for scripts and commands that require multiple confirmations, across all supported shells and both foreground and background terminals. If you type in the terminal while a prompt is present, the prompt will hide automatically. When options and descriptions are provided (such as `[Y] Yes [N] No`), these are surfaced in the confirmation prompt.

In the below example, a script containing multiple prompts for user input is run via the agent. Confirmation prompts appear and I accept the actions, allowing the terminal script to finish running and the agent to provide a summary of what transpired.

<video src="images/1_104/prompt-input-demo.mp4" title="Example of input being detected and responded to" autoplay loop controls muted></video>

### Improved error detection for tasks with problem matchers

For tasks that use problem matchers, the agent now collects and surfaces errors based on the problem matcher results, rather than relying on the language model to evaluate output. Problems are presented in a dropdown within the chat progress message, allowing you to navigate directly to the problem location. This ensures that errors are reported only when relevant to the current task execution.

### Compound task support in agent mode

Agent mode now supports running compound tasks. When you run a compound task, the agent indicates progress and output for each dependent task, including any prompts for user input. This enables more complex workflows and better visibility into multi-step task execution.

In the example below, the VS Code - Build task is run. Output is assessed for each dependency task and a problem is surfaced to the user in the response and in the progress message dropdown.

<video src="images/1_104/build-task.mp4" title="Example of agent running the VS Code - Build task" autoplay loop controls muted></video>

### Accessibility: Focus chat confirmation action

We've added a command, **Focus Chat Confirmation** `(kb(workbench.action.chat.focusConfirmation))`, which will focus the confirmation dialog, if any, or announce to screen reader users that confirmation is not required.

### Configurable terminal tool shell integration timeout

Whenever the `runInTerminal` tool tries to create a terminal, it waits a period for shell integration to activate. If your shell is especially slow to start up, say you have a very heavy PowerShell profile, this could cause it to wait the previously fixed 5-second timeout and still end up failing in the end. This timeout is now configurable via the `setting(chat.tools.terminal.shellIntegrationTimeout)` setting.

### Prevent Command Prompt usage

Since shell integration isn't really possible in Command Prompt, at least with the capabilities that Copilot needs, Copilot now opts to use Windows PowerShell instead, which should have shell integration by default. This should improve the reliability of the `runInTerminal` tool when your default shell is Command Prompt.

If, for some reason, you want Copilot to use Command Prompt, this is currently not possible but we will likely be adding the ability to customize the terminal profile used by Copilot soon, which is tracked in [#253945](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/253945).

### Global auto approve setting change and warning

Global auto approve (aka "YOLO mode") has been [an experimental setting since v1.99](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_99#_agent-mode-tool-approvals). What we have observed is that users have been enabling this setting without thinking deeply enough about the consequences. Additionally, some users thought that enabling the `setting(chat.tools.autoApprove)` setting was a pre-requisite to enabling terminal auto approve, which was never the case.

To combat these misconceptions and to further protect our users, there is now a deservedly scary-looking warning the first time global auto approve attempts to be used, so the user can easily back out and disable the setting:

![A new modal dialog will show when global auto approve is being used for the first time](images/1_104/global-auto-approve-warning.png)

The setting has also been changed to the clearer `setting(chat.tools.global.autoApprove)` without any automatic migration, so all users (accidental or intentional) need to go and explicitly set it again.

### Math rendering enabled by default

Chat now can render mathematical equations in responses:

![Screenshot of the Chat view, showing inline and block equations in a chat response.](images/1_104/chat-math.png)

This feature is powered by [KaTeX](https://katex.org) and supports both inline and block math equations. Inline math equations can be written by wrapping the markup in single dollar signs (`$...$`), while block math equations use two dollar signs (`$$...$$`).

Math rendering can be disabled with the `setting(chat.math.enabled)` setting.

### Select tools in tool sets

The tool picker now shows the tools that are part of each tool set. You can individually enable or disable each tool.

The tools picker is available via the `Configure Tools...` button in the Chat view.

![Tool Picker showing tools inside tool sets](images/1_104/tools_in_toolsets.png)

### Use Custom Chat Mode in Prompt Files

Prompt files now also support custom modes in addition to the built-in chat modes.

![use a custom mode in prompt file](images/1_104/custom_modes_in_prompt_files.png)

Prompt files can be run with the Play button when opened in the editor, or as a slash command in the chat input box. The mode defines the system message.

### Automatically add AGENTS.md files

**Setting**: `setting(chat.useAgentsMdFile)`

When you have an `AGENTS.md` file in your workspace root(s), it is now automatically picked up as context for chat requests. You can control this behavior with the `setting(chat.useAgentsMdFile)` setting. See <https://agents.md/> for more information about `AGENTS.md` files.

### Configure prompt file suggestions

**Setting**: `setting(chat.promptFilesRecommendations)`

Teams often create custom prompt files to standardize AI workflows, but these prompts can be hard to discover when users need them most. You can now configure which prompt files appear as suggestions in the Chat welcome view based on contextual conditions. The new `setting(chat.promptFilesRecommendations)` setting supports both simple boolean values and when-clause expressions for context-aware suggestions.

```json
{
  "chat.promptFilesRecommendations": {
    "plan": true,                            // Always suggest
    "a11y-audit": "resourceExtname == .html", // Only for HTML files
    "document": "resourceLangId == markdown", // Only for Markdown files
    "debug": false                           // Never suggest
  }
}
```

This helps teams surface the right AI workflows at the right time, making custom prompts more discoverable and contextually relevant based on your current workspace and file type.

### Improve workspace embeddings

<!-- TODO: mjbvz -->

### Improved changed files experience

This iteration, the changed files list has been reworked with a few quality-of-life features. First, the list is now collapsed by default. While collapsed, the total number of changed files and the lines added or removed are displayed in the header. Second, when you stage or commit a file using the Source Control view, the change will automatically be accepted. Third, when you keep or accept a suggested change, the file is now removed from the list to conserve space. Lastly, changes _per file_ are now shown next to each list item.

These changes should improve your experience when working in Agent mode!

<video src="images/1_104/changed-files-list.mp4" title="Video uncollapsing the changed files list and accepting file entries to remove them from the list." autoplay loop controls muted></video>

### Chat sessions (Experimental)

We're continuing to evolve the chat sessions experience to help you collaborate more effectively with coding agents.

#### Chat sessions view

**Setting**: `setting(chat.agentSessionsViewLocation)`

We've significantly enhanced the Chat Sessions view to streamline how you manage both local and contributed chat sessions. You can now perform all key operations from a single, unified interface, making it easier to iterate and finalize your coding tasks.

 * **Status Bar tracking**: Monitor progress across multiple coding agents directly from the Status Bar.
 * **Multi-session support**: Launch and manage multiple chat sessions from the same view.
 * **Expanded context menus**: Access more actions to interact with your coding agents efficiently.
 * **Rich descriptions**: With rich description enabled, each list entry now includes detailed context to help you quickly find relevant information.

#### GitHub coding agent integration

We've improved the integration of GitHub coding agents with chat sessions to deliver a smoother, more intuitive experience.

* **Chat editor actions**: Easily view or apply code changes, and check out pull requests directly from the chat editor.
* **Seamless transitions**: Move from local chats to GitHub agent tasks with improved continuity.
* **Better session rendering**: Various improvements on cards and tools rendering for better visual clarity.
* **Performance boosts**: Faster session loading for a more responsive experience.

<video src="images/1_104/chat-sessions-view.mp4" title="Video showing Chat Sessions view and integration with GitHub coding agents." autoplay loop controls muted></video>

#### Delegate to coding agent

We continued to expand on ways to delegate local tasks in VS Code to coding agent.

#### Fix `TODOs` with coding agent

Comments starting with `TODO` now show a Code Action to quickly initiate a coding agent session.

![Screenshot of a code action above a 'TODO' comment called 'Delegate to coding agent'](images/1_104/coding-agent-todo.png)

#### Delegate from chat

**Setting**: `setting(githubPullRequests.codingAgent.uiIntegration)`

Additional context, including file references, are now forwarded to GitHub coding agent when you perform the **Delegate to coding agent** action in chat. This enables you to precisely plan out a task for coding agent to complete.

A new chat editor is opened with the coding agent's progress shown in real-time.

<video src="images/1_104/delegate-to-coding-agent.mp4" title="Delegating a task from sidebar chat to coding agent" autoplay loop controls muted></video>

### Editing Auto Approve

The agent will now ask you for confirmation before making edits to certain files. This is useful to prevent an agent which may have received malicious instructions from causing immediate negative side-effects on your machine.

Common system folders, dotfiles, and files outside your workspace will require confirmation by default. You can customize patterns where confirmation is requested with the setting `setting(chat.tools.edits.autoApprove)`.

### Skip Tool Calls

The "Cancel" button on tool calls has been replaced with a "Skip" action to let the agent continue without using the requested tool. You can still cancel the request or enter a new request via the chat input box.

## MCP

### Support for Server Instructions

VS Code now reads MCP server instructions and will include them in its base prompt.

### Cross-App Autodiscovery Off by Default

VS Code by default has automatically discovered MCP servers installed in other apps, such as those in Claude Code. As MCP support has matured in VS Code, we've now disabled this behavior, but it can be re-enabled using the setting `setting(chat.mcp.discovery.enabled)`.

### MCP access setting

**Setting**: `setting(chat.mcp.access)`

The `setting(chat.mcp.enabled)` setting that previously controlled whether MCP servers could run in VS Code has been migrated to a new `setting(chat.mcp.access)` setting with more descriptive options:

- `all` - Allow all MCP servers to run (equivalent to the previous `true` value)
- `none` - Disable MCP support entirely (equivalent to the previous `false` value)

## Accessibility


## Editor Experience

### Windows: support for window border color is back

**Setting**: `setting(window.border)`

We are happy to add a new setting `setting(window.border)` on Windows that enables you to show a colored border around the VS Code window. The setting has the following options:

* `default`: respect color theme settings, fallback to Windows settings
* `system`: respect Windows settings only (window title accent color)
* `off`: disable border colors
* `<color>`: specific color in Hex, RGB, RGBA, HSL, HSLA format

You can configure colors per workspace, making it easier to distinguish which workspace is opened in which window.

![Windows border colors](images/1_104/border.png)

When you configure `setting(window.border)` as `default`, a theme is able to set the border color for active and inactive windows using the `window.activeBorder` and `window.inactiveBorder` color keys. You can further override these colors from the `setting(workbench.colorCustomizations)` setting.

### Manage extension account preference via the Command Palette

We've added an **Accounts: Manage Extension Account Preferences** command to the Command Palette which, when invoked, shows you a list of extensions that have access to authentication accounts and lets you change the account that those extensions use. You are even able to sign in to a new account right from the list.

This builds on the [account management functionality that we added a year ago](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_94#_change-an-extensions-account-preference).

### Editor Tab Index

**Setting**: `setting(workbench.editor.showTabIndex)`

A new setting `setting(workbench.editor.showTabIndex)` is available to render the index of an editor tab in the tab's label. This can be helpful when you have many tabs open and want to quickly navigate between them using keyboard shortcuts.

![Screenshot of editor tabs with numbers in front of them, indicating their index.](images/1_104/editorTabIndex.png)

### Editor tab bar scrollbar visibility

**Setting**: `setting(workbench.editor.titleScrollbarVisibility)`

A new setting `workbench.editor.titleScrollbarVisibility` allows you to control when the scrollbar in the editor tab bar is visible. The default value `auto` will show the scrollbar only when the tabs overflow and a tab is hovered. You can also set it to `visible` to always show the scrollbar when the tabs overflow, or `hidden` to never show it.

### Issue Reporter Improvements

When reporting issues in VS Code or Extensions via the built in issue reporter, you can now choose either Create on Github or Preview on Github via a dropdown on the report button. If the button does not populate a dropdown and only shows Create or Preview, this is likely to mean that you are still loading extension data or need to ensure that you are signed in with a github account that provides the correct scopes.

![Dropdown showing Create on Github and Preview on Github in the issue reporter](images/1_104/issue-reporter-dropdown.png)

## Notebooks

### Improved NES suggestions (Experimental)

**Setting**: `setting(github.copilot.chat.notebook.enhancedNextEditSuggestions.enabled)`

We are experimenting with improving the quality of next edit suggestions for Notebooks. Currently, the language model has access to the contents of the active cell when generating suggestions. However, with the `setting(github.copilot.chat.notebook.enhancedNextEditSuggestions.enabled)` setting enabled, the language model has access to the entire notebook, enabling it to generate more accurate and higher-quality next edit suggestions.

### Configure inline suggestion show delay

**Setting**: `setting(editor.inlineSuggest.minShowDelay)`

A new setting `setting(editor.inlineSuggest.minShowDelay)` allows you to configure how quickly inline suggestions appear after you type. This can be useful if you find that suggestions are appearing too quickly and getting in the way of your typing.

## Source Control

### Preview and migrate Git worktree changes

You can now preview differences between worktree files and your current workspace by right-clicking on a worktree file to open the context menu in the Source Control Changes view and selecting **Compare with Workspace**.

![Context menu shown in the SCM view on a changed file in a worktree. Compare with Workspace is selected](images/1_104/image.png)

After reviewing your changes, you can use the **Migrate Worktree Changes...** command from the Command Palette (`kb(git.migrateWorktreeChanges)`) to merge all changes from a worktree into your current workspace. This makes it easy to work across multiple worktrees and selectively bring changes back into your main repository.

## Terminal

### Terminal window discoverability and polish

We were somewhat surprised to find that a common request we see on social media is to allow terminals to be opened in separate windows. We've actually had the ability to do this for around one and a half years, it just hasn't been particularly discoverable. So this iteration we added many entry points for this feature:

* The new command `kb(workbench.action.terminal.newInNewWindow)`.
* The empty editor and tab well menus now have a **New Terminal** entry.
* The new terminal dropdown has been shuffled around and now has a **New Terminal Window** entry.
* The top-level terminal menu now has a **New Terminal Window** entry.

We also polished the experience where these new terminal windows open in compact mode. If you add a new tab to the window, it automatically exits compact mode.

![Terminal windows now open in compact mode, hiding tabs to make more room for terminal content](images/1_104/terminal-window.png)

### Terminal actions in terminal editors

The actions that are available in the terminal view (new terminal dropdown, clear terminal, etc.) are now also available for terminals in the editor area and terminal windows.

![Clear terminal, run active file and so on are available in the editor actions menu](images/1_104/terminal-editor-actions.png)

Just like in the terminal view, you can right-click the actions area to move them out of the overflow menu.

### Terminal IntelliSense improvements (Preview)

Terminal IntelliSense is getting several improvements this release:

* Multiple performance improvements, these disproportionately affect the experience on Windows.
* `git` completions are now more reliable on Windows due to the removal of the `sed` dependency which isn't available on Windows.
* `git` completions now have familiar icons to represent commits, branches, remotes, stashes and tags.
    ![New icons show for tags and branches on completions for "git checkout"](images/1_104/terminal-suggest.png)
* A large number of completion specs have been added: `adb`, `basename`, `bundle`, `clear`, `cut`, `date`, `dd`, `diff`, `dig`, `dirname`, `docker-compose`, `docker`, `dotnet`, `env`, `export`, `fdisk`, `fmt`, `fold`, `gh`, `go`, `htop`, `id`, `jq`, `ln`, `lsblk`, `lsof`, `mount`, `nl`, `od`, `paste`, `ping`, `pkill`, `readlink`, `rsync`, `ruby`, `ruff`, `sed`, `seq`, `shred`, `sort`, `source`, `split`, `stat`, `su`, `sudo`, `tac`, `tar`, `tee`, `time`, `tr`, `traceroute`, `tree`, `truncate`, `uniq`, `unzip`, `wc`, `where`, `whereis`, `which`, `who`, `xargs`, `xxd`, `yo`, `zip`

### Terminal sticky scroll improvements

We have now enabled terminal sticky scroll by default. We have made several improvements to provide better experience such as when using pager, and also have made terminal sticky scroll compatible with the `setting(editor.tabFocusMode)` setting.

## Languages

### JavaScript and TypeScript

#### Removed built-in Bower package IntelliSense

After reviewing usage numbers, we decided to remove our built-in `bower.json` IntelliSense. Bower has been [deprecated since 2017](https://bower.io/blog/2017/how-to-migrate-away-from-bower/) and our built-in support had little usage and was not being actively maintained.

Bower recommends that users migrate to `npm` or `yarn`. Continued support for Bower in VS Code can be provided by extensions.


### Python

#### The Python Environments extension supports Pipenv

Pipenv environments can now be discovered and selected just like in the Python extension. In addition, they appear in the **Environment Manager** view in the Python sidebar, where they are grouped and displayed alongside your other environment types.

![Screenshot showing the Python sidebar with Pipenv environments expanded.](images/1_104/pipenv-supported-screenshot.png)

#### Setting to control environment variable injection

A new setting, `setting(python.useEnvFile)`, controls whether environment variables from `.env` files and the `setting(python.envFile)` setting are injected into terminals when the Python Environments extension is enabled.

#### Python Environments extension improvements

The [Python Environments Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.vscode-python-envs) continued to receive bug fixes and improvements as part of the controlled roll-out to stable users. To use the Python Environments extension during the roll-out, make sure the extension is installed and add the following to your VS Code `settings.json` file: `"python.useEnvironmentsExtension": true`.

#### AI-powered hover summaries with Pylance (Experimental)

A new experimental AI hover summaries feature is now available for Python when using Pylance. When you enable the `setting(python.analysis.aiHoverSummaries)` setting, you can get helpful summaries on-the-fly for symbols that do not already have documentation. This makes it easier to understand unfamiliar code and boosts productivity as you explore Python projects. AI hover summaries are currently available to GitHub Copilot Pro, Pro+, and Enterprise users.

<video src="images/1_104/pylance-hover-summaries.mp4" title="Video showing AI-powered hover summaries with Pylance." autoplay loop controls muted></video>

#### Run code snippet tool

Instead of relying on terminal commands like `python -c "code"` or creating temporary files to be executed, the Pylance run code snippets tool enables GitHub Copilot to execute Python snippets entirely in memory. It automatically uses the correct Python interpreter configured for your workspace, and it eliminates common issues with shell escaping and quoting that sometimes arise during terminal execution.

One of the standout benefits is the clean, well-formatted output it provides, with both stdout and stderr interleaved for clarity. This makes it ideal when using agent mode with GitHub Copilot to test small blocks of code, run quick scripts, validate Python expressions, or checking imports, all within the context of your workspace.

To try it out, you can select the `pylancerunCodeSnippet` tool via the **Add context...** > **Tools** menu in the Chat view.

> **Note**: As with all AI-generated code, please make sure to inspect the generated code before allowing this tool to be executed. Reviewing the logic and intent of the code ensures it aligns with your project's goals and maintains safety and correctness.

#### Pylance IntelliSense enabled in all Python documents by default

Pylance IntelliSense is now enabled by default in all Python documents, including terminal and diff views. With the `setting(python.analysis.supportAllPythonDocuments)` setting now set to `true` by default, you get rich code completions, hover and code navigation wherever you work with Python in VS Code.

#### Activation hooks

Python activation hooks can now run from shell integration scripts, instead of requiring the Python environment extension to modify your shell profile. This provides more reliable terminal activation when `setting(python-envs.terminal.autoActivationType)` is set to `shellStartup` and, importantly, ensures Copilot terminals are activated as expected.

## Contributions to extensions

### GitHub Pull Requests

There has been more progress on the [GitHub Pull Requests](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github) extension, which enables you to work on, create, and manage pull requests and issues. New features include:

* Side Bar content collapses on narrow windows
* Pull request and issue webviews restore after reload
* The new "TODO" code action lets you delegate directly to the Copilot coding agent
* Submodules can be ignored with `setting(githubPullRequests.ignoreSubmodules)`

Review the [changelog for the 0.118.0](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-pull-request-github/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#01180) release of the extension to learn about everything in the release.

## Extension Authoring

### shellIntegrationNonce for extension launched terminals

`shellIntegrationNonce` can now be passed to `createTerminal` in `TerminalOptions` and `ExtensionTerminalOptions`. This enables the extension to control the nonce which is used to verify commands [in shell integration escape sequences](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/shell-integration#_supported-escape-sequences).

### New chat provider API

This iteration we finalized the `LanguageModelChatProviders` API. This enables extensions to contribute language models to VS Code and Copilot Chat. You can learn more about how to utilize this API in our [extension guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/ai/language-model-chat-provider) or in our [extension sample](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-extension-samples/tree/main/chat-model-provider-sample).


## Proposed APIs

### Authentication: Supporting `WWW-Authenticate` challenges in `getSession`

A well-established pattern of HTTP is that a request to an API can return a 401 Unauthorized status code with a [WWW-Authenticate](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/WWW-Authenticate) header which defines "auth challenges". These are essentially things that the API needs in order to resolve past the 401.

We have introduced a proposed API which allows for the passing down and handling of these challenges to authentication providers. First off, from the calling side you can now pass in a challenge like so:

```ts
export interface AuthenticationWWWAuthenticateRequest {
	/**
	 * The raw WWW-Authenticate header value that triggered this challenge.
	 */
	readonly wwwAuthenticate: string;

	/**
	 * Optional scopes for the session.
	 */
	readonly scopes?: readonly string[];
}

export namespace authentication {
		// NOTE: The only change is the 2nd parameter, the other variations of `getSession` have the same change
		export function getSession(providerId: string, scopeListOrRequest: ReadonlyArray<string> | AuthenticationWWWAuthenticateRequest, options?: AuthenticationGetSessionOptions): Thenable<AuthenticationSession | undefined>;
}
```

On the authentication provider side, we have added the following two new functions to `AuthenticationProvider`:
```ts
getSessionsFromChallenges(constraint: AuthenticationConstraint, options: AuthenticationProviderSessionOptions): Thenable<readonly AuthenticationSession[]>;
createSessionFromChallenges(constraint: AuthenticationConstraint, options: AuthenticationProviderSessionOptions): Thenable<AuthenticationSession>;
```
and an auth provider can declare support for challenges when registered via `supportsChallenges: true` in `AuthenticationProviderOptions`.

#### Example: Azure MFA

This work was initially done [due to an upcoming change to require MFA in Azure APIs](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/authentication/concept-mandatory-multifactor-authentication) so let's also use that as an example of this API.

Let's say you have an extension that creates a resource in Azure. All that's doing is calling an Azure RM API, nothing fancy...  Your extension is probably already familiar with calling `vscode.authentication.getSession` to get an authentication session, mainly an access token, that can be used to call this API. Now, when you first minted that authentication session, depending on your organization, you may or may NOT have gone through multi-factor authentication (MFA). If you did, then the Azure API will be happy. If you _didn't_ go through MFA, then Azure's API will return a 401 and a `WWW-Authenticate` header.

Now comes our new API in VS Code... all you have to do is take that header value, and pass it right in to `vscode.authentication.getSession`:

```ts
const newRequest = {
  wwwAuthenticate: theRawHeaderValue,
  scopes: scopesFromPreviousRequest
}
const sessionWithMFA = await vscode.authentication.getSession('microsoft', newRequest, options)
```

This will pass that header value down to the `microsoft` auth provider, and the auth provider will be responsible for minting a session in which the challenges are satisfied.

#### Next steps

Next iteration we will finalize the `getSession` (aka extension asking for auth) parts of this proposal so if you have any feedback on that or the shape of the `AuthenticationProvider` changes, please let us know! You can [find the full proposal on GitHub here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/a924f20c72bd8f9665894be8213ce7f5680ab528/src/vscode-dts/vscode.proposed.authenticationChallenges.d.ts).

Another use case that will be lit up soon regarding `WWW-Authenticate`, is for MCP servers to issue a `WWW-Authenticate` header asking for a token with more scopes. There's [a proposal in the MCP specification for this](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/pull/835).

### View containers in the secondary side bar

Extensions can contribute view containers to the `activitybar` and `panel`. We have now added support for contributing to the `secondarySidebar` as well. This is currently behind the `contribSecondarySideBar` proposed API. We are hoping to finalize this API soon.


## Engineering

### Exploring Playwright + Playwright MCP in the inner development loop of VS Code

Agent mode and other AI features of VS Code have become a core tool (no pun intended) for the VS Code team to build VS Code itself. We wanted to explore how we can leverage these features further to make the inner development loop of VS Code even better. To that end, we have been experimenting with extending our existing smoke test [automation project](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/tree/main/test/automation), which uses [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/), to create an MCP server that can drive a local instance of VS Code. This allows our existing agentic flows, which focused on receiving context from build/test-time artifacts (compilation, linters, tests, etc.), to now also interact with a live instance of VS Code... verifying that changes have the desired effect at runtime.

The first piece of this work can be found [in the test/mcp folder](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/tree/main/test/mcp) of the vscode repo. If you're interested in trying it out, it's very easy to get started:

1. Follow the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/How-to-Contribute) for getting a local version of Code OSS running
2. Then you can use [our trivial (for now) prompt file](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/cd7de11f65cd5ff6a491f04fc013e363780bde31/.github/prompts/playwright.prompt.md) to ask a question `/playwright your question here` in Agent mode.

This is still an early exploration, but we are excited about the possibilities this opens up for us to leverage AI further in our inner development loop. The ground work is now laid, and we will be iterating on this to make it more robust and useful for the team.

This work was recently featured on the VS Code Insiders podcast, where we discussed the motivations behind this exploration and some of the technical details. You can listen to the episode [here](https://www.vscodepodcast.com/3).
