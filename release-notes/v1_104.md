Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the August 1.104 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the August milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/main)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A%22August+2025%22)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

## Chat

### View All File Changes Summary

It is now possible to view a summary of all the file changes done in a specific turn using the setting `chat.checkpoints.showFileChanges`. When enabled, it will show a widget showing all the edits done during a turn. You can also view all the file changes of the turn at once in a multi-diff editor from there. 

We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.
