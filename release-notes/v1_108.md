## Agents

### Agent skills

VS Code now supports **Agent Skills**, allowing you to teach the coding agent new capabilities and provide domain-specific knowledge.

To enable this preview feature, set `chat.useAgentSkills` to `true` in your settings.

Learn more about creating and using skills in the [Agent Skills documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/agent-skills).

## Chat

### Improvements to agent sessions view

A couple of changes and improvements to the agent sessions view include:
- keyboard access support for actions such as archive, read state, opening
- grouping of sessions based on state and age when showing side by side
- more emphasis on changed files and associated PRs for a session
- support to archive multiple sessions at once from the new group sections
- general accessibility improvements

![agent sessions](images/1_108/agentsessions.png)

Note: `setting(chat.viewSessions.orientation)` no longer provides the `auto` option. Pick `sideBySide` as alternative.

### Chat picker is based on agent sessions

The quick picker for chat sessions is now based on the same information that drives the agent sessions view. You can access any previous chat session from there and perform actions like archiving, renaming or deletion.

![agent picker](images/1_108/agentpicker.png)

Note: Agent sessions can also be accessed by typing `agent ` into the quick open control.

### Chat title control improvements

The chat title control is now showing up irrespective of how the activity bar is configured. Previously it only showed up in the default configuration, but now it will be present always. This control now gives you a quick way to jump to another chat session by clicking it:

![agent title control](images/1_108/agentittle.png)

This utilises the new chat sessions picker.

### Previous chat sessions no longer restore after restart automatically

The `setting(chat.viewRestorePreviousSession)` is now disabled by default so that a restart will restore to empty chat view. You can always access previous chats from the agent sessions control in the chat view.

### Terminal tool auto approve default rule improvements

The follows commands will now be auto approved by default when the feature is active:

- `git ls-files`
- `git --no-pager <safe_subcommand>`
- `git -C <dir> <safe_subcommand>`
- `rg` (excluding `--pre` and `--hostname-bin`)
- `sed` (excluding some args and usage patterns)
- `Out-String`

In addition to the above, npm scripts run through `npm`, `pnpm` or `yarn` will now be auto approved by default when they are included within the package.json. We do this because agent mode requires workspace trust and we protect agent mode itself from editing files like package.json. This can be disabled with `setting(chat.tools.terminal.autoApproveWorkspaceNpmScripts)`.

To improve transparency around auto approve there is now an informational message when the rule was explicitly denied by either default or custom rules:

![Auto approval denied by rule will show after a denial](images/1_108/terminal-tool-deny.png)

### Easily add session and workspace rules for future terminal tool commands

Allow commands or command line entries in the allow dropdown now have options to do the same for the session or to add them to the workspace settings file:

![alt text](images/1_108/terminal-tool-allow-dropdown.png)

### Terminal tool preventing adding to shell history

Provided shell integration is enabled and working, commands run by the terminal tool should no longer enter shell history for bash, zsh, pwsh and fish. The method this uses differs for each shell, for bash for example `HISTCONTROL=ignorespace` is set and a space is added to the start of the command being run. This can be disabled via `setting(chat.tools.terminal.preventShellHistory)`

## MCP


## Accessibility

### Streaming chat responses in accessible view

The Accessible View now dynamically streams chat responses as they are generated. Previously, you needed to close and reopen the accessible view to see updated content. Now, you can stay in the accessible view and monitor output as it comes in, making it much easier to follow along with AI responses in real time.

### MCP server output excluded from accessible view

MCP (Model Context Protocol) server output is now excluded from the accessible view by default to reduce noise. The standard chat output remains fully accessible, as it's presented in a text area that works well with screen readers.


### Language ID variable in window title

A new `${activeEditorLanguageId}` variable is now available for the `window.title` setting. This variable displays the language identifier of the currently active editor, which is useful for accessibility tools like Talon that need to determine the current programming language to enable appropriate voice commands.

```json
"window.title": "${activeEditorLanguageId} - ${activeEditorShort}"
```

## Editor Experience

### Copy Breadcrumbs Path

You can now copy the breadcrumbs path to the clipboard using the **Copy Breadcrumbs Path** command. This is useful when you need to share the exact location of a symbol with your team or for documentation purposes.

![Copy breadcrumbs path command](images/1_108/breadcrumbs_copy_path.png)

The `breadcrumbs.symbolPathSeparator` setting allows you to customize the separator character used to join breadcrumb segments.

## Code Editing

### New Snippet Tranformations

There are two new snippet transformations available: `snakecase` and `kebabcase`. This is how you can use them:

For snake_case transformation:

```
${TM_FILENAME/(.*)/${1:/snakecase}/}
```

This transforms the filename to snake_case format. For example, from `MyFileName.txt` it makes `my_file_name.txt`. The kebab-case transformation is `my-file-name.txt`.


## Notebooks


## Source Control

### Git blame information settings

**Settings**: `setting(git.blame.ignoreWhitespace:true)`, `setting(git.blame.editorDecoration.disableHover:true)`

The new `setting(git.blame.ignoreWhitespace)` setting allows you to configure Git blame to ignore whitespace changes when determining which commit last modified a line. This is particularly useful when working with code that has been reformatted, as it helps you identify the commit that made the actual functional change rather than just whitespace adjustments.

Additionally, the `setting(git.blame.editorDecoration.disableHover)` setting lets you disable the hover tooltip that appears when you hover over Git blame editor decoration. This can be useful if you prefer a cleaner editing experience and only want to see the inline blame annotations without the additional hover information.

### Improvements to authoring the commit message using the editor

Some time ago we have added the capability to use the full editor to [author the commit message](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/staging-commits#_use-the-editor-for-commit-messages) but the actions to Commit/Cancel were difficult to discover in the editor title toolbar. We have recently made improvements to the editor content toolbar that is shown in the lower right-hand corner of the editor that allowed us to move these actions there to help with discoverability.

### Worktrees in the Source Control Repositories view (Experimental)

**Settings**: `setting(scm.repositories.explorer:true)`, `setting(scm.repositories.selectionMode:single)`

This milestone, we have added a Worktrees node to the Source Control Repositories view. Under this node, you can see the list of the repository worktrees with an inline action to open the worktree in a new window. The context menu also contains an action to open the worktree in the current window, as well as an action to delete the worktree.

You can enable the experimental repository explorer by setting the `setting(scm.repositories.selectionMode:single)` and `setting(scm.repositories.explorer:true)` settings. Please give it a try and let us know what other repository artifacts you would like to see in the repositories explorer.

## Debugging


## Tasks


## Terminal

### Terminal IntelliSense default UX rework

During the past 2 releases we rolled out terminal IntelliSense to all stable users and while much of the feedback we saw was positive, there was a segment of users (mostly terminal power users) that did not like the feature at all for breaking their muscle memory. There was a lot of discussion and we ultimately decided to switch some defaults, improve discoverability and allow easier inline configuration of the feature.

The feature itself is still enabled by default, but instead of showing the widget automatically when typing (aka. quick suggestions and suggest on trigger characters) now needs to be explicitly triggered via `kbstyle(Ctrl+Space)`.

The "status bar" on the bottom has been improved as well, previously it showed insert on the left, and learn more/configure on the right with their associated keybindings. We got some feedback that it's not clear these can be interacted with so we now show icons on the right and no longer show the keybindings. The left action now allows rotating through the options for "selection mode" which is what determines how tab and enter react when it's brought up, and there's a new eye icon on the right which easily enabled quick suggestions and suggest on trigger characters again:

![The suggest status bar has changed and now inludes buttons to configure selection mode and whether to show on type](images/1_108/terminal-suggest.png)

Finally, in order to still make this powerful feature relatively discoverable without being overbearing, the hint that shows when opening a terminal will explain how to show suggestions:

![The hint that shows when opening a terminal now explains how to trigger "show suggestions"](images/1_108/terminal-initial-hint.png)

The lifecycle of the hint has been simplified and it's as easy as clicking don't show to get rid of it permanently just like the similar feature in the editor.

Beyond this UX rework, these improvements were also done:

- We no show files with the executable bit on macOS/Linux
- Improved completions for `npm` and `git`
- Several fixes to the feature

### Performance and stability improvements

The terminal saw several important performance and stability improvements this release:

- [node-pty#831](https://github.com/microsoft/node-pty/pull/831): On macOS and Linux, pasting more than 50 characters at once or having Copilot run a large command will no longer be throttled and should apply essentially instantly, scaling similarly to other terminals with KBs/MBs of data. This also fixed a crash that could happen on macOS when doing the same thing.
- [vscode#285031](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/285031), [vscode#285032](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/285032), [xterm.js#5548](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/issues/5548): Fixed several layout thrashing issues that could cause the editor to get laggy.
- [vscode#239541](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/239541): Fixed a crash that could occur when fonts such as CommitMono were configured in the terminal.

### More comprehensive custom glyphs

The terminal's GPU accelerated renderer (on by default) has supported custom glyphs for some time for box drawing, block element and a subset of powerline symbols. This means you can see these characters without needing to configure a font and they will also scale with line height, letter spacing and should align with each other perfectly.

In this release we expanded the number of characters supported to almost 800 by including the majority of custom glyphs supported by any other terminal. This includes ranges that are generally useful in a terminal, specifically these ranges:

- Box Drawing (`U+2500`-`U+257F`)
- Block Elements (`U+2580`-`U+259F`)
- Braille Patterns (`U+2800`-`U+28FF`)
- Powerline Symbols (`U+E0A0`-`U+E0D4`, Private Use Area)
- Progress Indicators (`U+EE00`-`U+EE0B`, Private Use Area)
- Git Branch Symbols (`U+F5D0`-`U+F60D`, Private Use Area)
- Symbols for Legacy Computing (`U+1FB00`-`U+1FBFF`)

Here's a visual of the complete set of glyphs:

![There are about 800 custom glyphs we now render without needing a font](images/1_108/terminal-custom-glyphs.png)

### Improved rendering of curly underlines

VS Code has been able to parse and display [colored and styled underlines](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/underlines/) for some time now, but the curly underline's rendering always left something to be desired. The curly underlines should now look very close to how they look in the editor:

![The terminal curly underline is a lot more vivid now and has a zigzag look like in the editor](images/1_108/terminal-curly-underline.png)

You can try this out yourself by running this in bash: `echo -e '\x1b[4:3mCurly\x1b[0m \x1b[4:3m\x1b[58;5;1mRed\x1b[0m'`

### Visual overlay with dimensions on resize

It may be important to resize your terminal precisely, we now show a brief overlay with the dimensions as the resize occurs:

![As a terminal resize happens, an overlay appears in the middle of the terminal with the current columns and rows](images/1_108/terminal-resize-overlay.png)

This was inspired by a similar feature in [ghostty](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty).

### New VT features

The terminal now supports the follow VT features/sequences:

- [Synchronized output](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/284592): This can be used by applications to pause rendering and batch updates the terminal, which is particularly useful to prevent tearing when rewriting the buffer.
  - DECRQM (`CSI ? 2026 $ p`)
  - BSU (`CSI ? 2026 h`)
  - ESU (`CSI ? 2026 l`)
- [XTVERSION](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/285138) (`CSI > 0 q`): This allows applications to query details about the terminal, the response VS Code will give currently is the "xterm.js" and its version

## Authentication

## Contributions to extensions

### GitHub Pull Requests

There has been more progress on the [GitHub Pull Requests](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github) extension, which enables you to work on, create, and manage pull requests and issues. New features include:

* Change a pull request's base branch from the pull request description webview.
* Convert open pull requests to draft from the pull request description webview.
* Generate a pull request description for an existing PR, not just new ones.

Review the [changelog for the 0.126.0](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-pull-request-github/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#01260) release of the extension to learn about everything in the release.

## Extension Authoring

### New Quick Pick properties for prompts and resource URIs

The Quick Pick API includes two new properties for creating interactive selection interfaces.

Use the `prompt` property on `QuickPick` to display persistent instructional text beneath the input box. The text remains visible while users type, which helps provide guidance or context.

```typescript
const quickPick = vscode.window.createQuickPick();
quickPick.prompt = 'Select a file to open';
quickPick.items = items;
quickPick.show();
```

Use the `resourceUri` property on `QuickPickItem` to automatically derive item properties from a resource URI. When provided, VS Code derives:

* The `label` from the file name (when set to an empty string)
* The `description` from the file path (when set to `undefined` or an empty string)
* The `icon` from the current file icon theme (when `iconPath` is set to `ThemeIcon.File` or `ThemeIcon.Folder`)

This is useful when building file or folder selection interfaces.

```typescript
const items: vscode.QuickPickItem[] = [
  {
    label: '',
    resourceUri: vscode.Uri.file('/path/to/app.ts'),
    iconPath: vscode.ThemeIcon.File
  },
  {
    label: '',
    resourceUri: vscode.Uri.file('/path/to/src'),
    iconPath: vscode.ThemeIcon.Folder
  }
];
```

### Housekeeping

As part of our annual December housekeeping, we spent a majority of time cleaning our Github issues and pull requests across all of our maintained repositories. This year we managed to reduce our open issues by 5,951 and triaged another 1,203 issues.

![Issue graph for all VS Code managed repositories.](images/1_108/combined-graph.png)
![Total amount of open issues closed during housekeeping.](images/1_108/issue-reduction.png)
![Total amount of unknown issues triaged during housekeeping (excluding closed issues).](images/1_108/unknown-reduction.png)

By leveraging improved triage tooling and deduplication processes, we were able to close a significant number of stale and resolved issues. This has left us with a more manageble project, allowing us to move forward and develop the features that will have the most impact for our users. In our core VS Code repository alone, we closed 2,872 issues and triaged another 1,697!

![Issue graph for microsoft/vscode.](images/1_108/vscode-graph.png)

In June of 2025, we also announced that Copilot had become Open Source! This meant that all of our issues would filed in microsoft/vscode, and that we had a backlog of issues remaining in microsoft/vscode-copilot-release to take care of. This month we triaged every issue in the repository and closed 1,659 issues, leaving only 175 open to be migrated.

![Issue graph for microsoft/vscode-copilot-release.](images/1_108/vscode-copilot-release-graph.png)

Below is a graph showing how our core vscode repository has grown over the years, and how many issues our amazing community has contributed over time. We appreciate everyone who has contributed issues to all of our repositores over the years and continued to engaged with us. Your feedback is what has made VS Code the product that it is today! 🚀
