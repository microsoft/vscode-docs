## Agents


## Chat

### Terminal tool auto approve default rule improvements

TODO: Tyriar

- Default rule additions git ls-files, git -C <dir>, git --no-pager, Out-String, rg, sed
  - https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/285744
  - https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/285429
  - https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/282824
  - https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/282209
  - https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/262909
- npm script package.json https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/285509
- Denied rule message https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/285921

### Easily add session and workspace rules for future terminal tool commands

### Terminal tool preventing adding to shell history

https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/276716

## MCP


## Accessibility

### Streaming chat responses in accessible view

The Accessible View now dynamically streams chat responses as they are generated. Previously, you needed to close and reopen the accessible view to see updated content. Now, you can stay in the accessible view and monitor output as it comes in, making it much easier to follow along with AI responses in real time.

### MCP server output excluded from accessible view

MCP (Model Context Protocol) server output is now excluded from the accessible view by default to reduce noise. The standard chat output remains fully accessible, as it's presented in a text area that works well with screen readers.


### Language ID variable in window title

A new `${activeEditorLanguageId}` variable is now available for the `window.title` setting. This variable displays the language identifier of the currently active editor, which is useful for accessibility tools like Talon that need to determine the current programming language to enable appropriate voice commands.

```json
"window.title": "${activeEditorLanguageId} - ${activeEditorShort}"
```

## Editor Experience

### Copy Breadcrumbs Path

You can now copy the breadcrumbs path to the clipboard using the **Copy Breadcrumbs Path** command. This is useful when you need to share the exact location of a symbol with your team or for documentation purposes.

![Copy breadcrumbs path command](images/1_108/breadcrumbs_copy_path.png)

The `breadcrumbs.symbolPathSeparator` setting allows you to customize the separator character used to join breadcrumb segments.

## Code Editing

### New Snippet Tranformations

There are two new snippet transformations available: `snakecase` and `kebabcase`. This is how you can use them:

For snake_case transformation:

```
${TM_FILENAME/(.*)/${1:/snakecase}/}
```

This transforms the filename to snake_case format. For example, from `MyFileName.txt` it makes `my_file_name.txt`. The kebab-case transformation is `my-file-name.txt`.

## Terminal

### Terminal IntelliSense default UX rework

During the past 2 releases we rolled out terminal IntelliSense to all stable users and while much of the feedback we saw was positive, there was a segment of users (mostly terminal power users) that did not like the feature at all for breaking their muscle memory. There was a lot of discussion and we ultimately decided to switch some defaults, improve discoverability and allow easier inline configuration of the feature.

The feature itself is still enabled by default, but instead of showing the widget automatically when typing (aka. quick suggestions and suggest on trigger characters) now needs to be explicitly triggered via `kbstyle(Ctrl+Space)`.

The "status bar" on the bottom has been improved as well, previously it showed insert on the left, and learn more/configure on the right with their associated keybindings. We got some feedback that it's not clear these can be interacted with so we now show icons on the right and no longer show the keybindings. The left action now allows rotating through the options for "selection mode" which is what determines how tab and enter react when it's brought up, and there's a new eye icon on the right which easily enabled quick suggestions and suggest on trigger characters again:

![The suggest status bar has changed and now inludes buttons to configure selection mode and whether to show on type](images/1_108/terminal-suggest.png)

Finally, in order to still make this powerful feature relatively discoverable without being overbearing, the hint that shows when opening a terminal will explain how to show suggestions:

![alt text](images/1_108/terminal-initial-hint.png)

The lifecycle of the hint has been simplified and it's as easy as clicking don't show to get rid of it permanently just like the similar feature in the editor.

Beyond this UX rework, there were some fixes to the feature and we also added support to only show files with the executable bit on macOS/Linux.

### Expanded git log completions

Terminal shell integration suggestions now include a more complete set of `git log` options. Previously, only a limited subset of options was available. For example, typing `git log --f` now suggests additional flags beyond just `--follow`, providing a more comprehensive autocomplete experience that better matches Git's full command-line options.

### Performance and stability improvements

The terminal saw several important performance and stability improvements this release:

- [node-pty#831](https://github.com/microsoft/node-pty/pull/831): On macOS and Linux, pasting more than 50 characters at once or having Copilot run a large command will no longer be throttled and should apply essentially instantly, scaling similarly to other terminals with KBs/MBs of data. This also fixed a crash that could happen on macOS when doing the same thing.
- [vscode#285031](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/285031), [vscode#285032](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/285032), [xterm.js#5548](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/issues/5548): Fixed several layout thrashing issues related to terminal tabs and the command guide.
- [vscode#239541](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/239541): Fixed a crash that could occur when fonts such as CommitMono were configured in the terminal.

### More comprehensive custom glyphs

TODO: Tyriar
https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/284758

### Improved rendering of curly underlines

VS Code has been able to parse and display [colored and styled underlines](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/underlines/) for some time now, but the curly underline's rendering always left something to be desired. The curly underlines should now look very close to how they look in the editor:

![The terminal curly underline is a lot more vivid now and has a zigzag look like in the editor](images/1_108/terminal_curly_underline.png)

You can try this out yourself using something like `echo -e '\x1b[4:3mCurly\x1b[0m \x1b[4:3m\x1b[58;5;1mRed\x1b[0m'`

### Visual overlay with dimensions on resize

https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/284046

### New VT features

The terminal now supports the follow VT features/sequences:

- [Synchronized output](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/284592): This can be used by applications to pause rendering and batch updates the terminal, which is particularly useful to prevent tearing when rewriting the buffer.
  - DECRQM (`CSI ? 2026 $ p`)
  - BSU (`CSI ? 2026 h`)
  - ESU (`CSI ? 2026 l`)
- [XTVERSION](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/285138) (`CSI > 0 q`): This allows applications to query details about the terminal, the response VS Code will give currently is the underlying xterm.js version.

## Authentication


## Languages


## Remote Development

The [Remote Development extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack), allow you to use a [Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers), remote machine via SSH or [Remote Tunnels](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/tunnels), or the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl) (WSL) as a full-featured development environment.

Highlights include:

* TODO: @ntrogh

You can learn more about these features in the [Remote Development release notes](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/blob/main/remote-release-notes/v1_108.md).


## Contributions to extensions

### GitHub Pull Requests

There has been more progress on the [GitHub Pull Requests](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github) extension, which enables you to work on, create, and manage pull requests and issues. New features include:

* Change a pull request's base branch from the pull request description webview.
* Convert open pull requests to draft from the pull request description webview.
* Generate a pull request description for an existing PR, not just new ones.
