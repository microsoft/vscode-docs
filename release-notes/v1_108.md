## Agents


## Chat


## MCP


## Accessibility

### Streaming chat responses in accessible view

The Accessible View now dynamically streams chat responses as they are generated. Previously, you needed to close and reopen the accessible view to see updated content. Now, you can stay in the accessible view and monitor output as it comes in, making it much easier to follow along with AI responses in real time.

### MCP server output excluded from accessible view

MCP (Model Context Protocol) server output is now excluded from the accessible view by default to reduce noise. The standard chat output remains fully accessible, as it's presented in a text area that works well with screen readers.


### Language ID variable in window title

A new `${activeEditorLanguageId}` variable is now available for the `window.title` setting. This variable displays the language identifier of the currently active editor, which is useful for accessibility tools like Talon that need to determine the current programming language to enable appropriate voice commands.

```json
"window.title": "${activeEditorLanguageId} - ${activeEditorShort}"
```

## Editor Experience

### Copy Breadcrumbs Path

You can now copy the breadcrumbs path to the clipboard using the **Copy Breadcrumbs Path** command. This is useful when you need to share the exact location of a symbol with your team or for documentation purposes.

![Copy breadcrumbs path command](images/1_108/breadcrumbs_copy_path.png)

The `breadcrumbs.symbolPathSeparator` setting allows you to customize the separator character used to join breadcrumb segments.

## Code Editing

### New Snippet Tranformations

There are two new snippet transformations available: `snakecase` and `kebabcase`. This is how you can use them:

For snake_case transformation:

```
${TM_FILENAME/(.*)/${1:/snakecase}/}
```

This transforms the filename to snake_case format. For example, from `MyFileName.txt` it makes `my_file_name.txt`. The kebab-case transformation is `my-file-name.txt`.


## Notebooks


## Source Control


## Debugging


## Tasks


## Terminal

### Expanded git log completions

Terminal shell integration suggestions now include a more complete set of `git log` options. Previously, only a limited subset of options was available. For example, typing `git log --f` now suggests additional flags beyond just `--follow`, providing a more comprehensive autocomplete experience that better matches Git's full command-line options.


## Authentication


## Languages


## Remote Development

The [Remote Development extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack), allow you to use a [Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers), remote machine via SSH or [Remote Tunnels](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/tunnels), or the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl) (WSL) as a full-featured development environment.

Highlights include:

* TODO: @ntrogh

You can learn more about these features in the [Remote Development release notes](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/blob/main/remote-release-notes/v1_108.md).


## Contributions to extensions

### GitHub Pull Requests

There has been more progress on the [GitHub Pull Requests](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github) extension, which enables you to work on, create, and manage pull requests and issues. New features include:

* Change a pull request's base branch from the pull request description webview.
* Convert open pull requests to draft from the pull request description webview.
* Generate a pull request description for an existing PR, not just new ones.

Review the [changelog for the 0.126.0](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-pull-request-github/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#01260) release of the extension to learn about everything in the release.

## Extension Authoring


## Proposed APIs


## Engineering


## Notable fixes

* [vscode#283356](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/283356) - Fixed regression causing jumping around while scrolling past some chat output
