# February 2018 (version 1.21)

## Insiders Release

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the February 1.21 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll see details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the February release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[February Iteration Plan](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/43361)** - See what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit Log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/59?closed=1)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the February milestone.

We really appreciate people taking a look at our new features as soon as they are ready so check back here often and learn what's new to try out.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the VS Code repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues).

## Workbench

### New Notifications UI

We updated the look and feel of notifications in VS Code. Notifications now :

* Slide in from the bottom right (unless the new Notification Center is opened).
* Can be dismissed and then reviewed later through the Notification Center.
* Can be expanded to show the full contents of the message.

Each notification has the following structure:

![Notification](images/1_21/notification.png)

If a notification does not provide any source information or any action buttons, it will show only a severity and message. These types of notifications will hide automatically after a certain timeout.

![Notification](images/1_21/notification-small.png)

A new entry ("bell" icon) in the bottom right of the Status Bar indicates the number of new notifications. Once clicked, the Notification Center will open that shows all notifications that were not dismissed yet.

![Notifications](images/1_21/notifications.gif)

Each notification can be managed with new commands and configurable keybindings (see below in the [New Commands](#new-commands) section).

**Note for extension and theme authors:** With the new notification UI, we introduced new theming colors for theme authors to adopt (see below). There is also a soft deprecation of the `isCloseAffordance` attribute for extension authors which is no longer needed when showing these style of notifications.

### Centered editor layout

By popular request [15684](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15684) we have added centered editor layout. This layout is designed to help in situations when you are deeply focused on your code and want the editor to take the most prominent part of the screen real estate. Opening multiple editors side by side will automatically exit centered layout until there is one editor group again. The left and right sash for resizing are coupled in order for the editor to always be centered, hold down the `alt` key if you want to resize the sashes independently. Double click on the sashes to bring them back to the default golden ratio size.
Zen mode will now automatically turn this mode on. Use `"zenMode.centerLayout"` setting to control this behavior.

![centeredLayout](images/1_21/centeredLayout.gif)

### Better drag and drop support

We revisited our support for drag and drop in the workbench and now support more drag and drop scenarios. Probably the most up-voted request was to drag files from one File Explorer to another VS Code instance:

![DND files across Windows](images/1_21/window-dnd-files.gif)

We now also support to drag and drop root folders in the File Explorer to rearrange their order as requested in [29715](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/29715).

Other improvements are to the **OPEN EDITORS** view. You can now:

* Drag files from the Explorer into a specific space of OPEN EDITORS.
* Drag files from the desktop into a specific space of OPEN EDITORS.
* Drag tabs into a specific space of OPEN EDITORS.

### Symbolic link indication in Explorer

We now indicate symbolic links in the File Explorer by an arrow decoration and additional hover text.

![symlink](images/1_21/symlink.png)

### Create multiple folders in the Explorer

This can also be used to create a new file:

![create multiple folder from the Explorer](images/1_21/explorer-multiFolderCreation.gif)

### Copy/Paste files across windows

We now allow you to copy and paste files between 2 VS Code File Explorers in different instances. This works for single or multi-selection of files as well as folders.

![Copy Paste across Windows](images/1_21/window-copy-paste.gif)

### NPM Script running

When running scripts in `package.json` files as tasks using **Tasks** > **Run Tasks**, scripts from `package.json` files in subfolders are now also detected. To exclude folders from script detection, use the `npm.exclude` setting.

### Preview: Horizontal search

This milestone we have added a configuration, `"search.location"`, to control the position of the Search view. To have more horizontal search results space, set `"search.location": "panel"`. This feature is currently in preview and we plan to further improve the layout within the Search view to take advantage of the additional horizontal space.

![Horizontal Search](images/1_21/search.png)

## Integrated Terminal

### Split terminals

Terminal can now be split such that multiple are visible at once, which can enable much easier management of terminals when you need a watch and a run command for example:

![Split terminals](images/1_21/terminal-split.gif)

Splitting can be done by clicking the split button in the panel, through the context menu or the command `kb(workbench.action.terminal.split)`.

Focus can be moved between split terminals using `kb(workbench.action.terminal.focusNextPane)` and `kb(workbench.action.terminal.focusPreviousPane)`. The active pane can be resized using the keyboard with:

* `workbench.action.terminal.resizePaneDown`: `kb(workbench.action.terminal.resizePaneDown)`
* `workbench.action.terminal.resizePaneUp`: `kb(workbench.action.terminal.resizePaneUp)`
* `workbench.action.terminal.resizePaneLeft`: `kb(workbench.action.terminal.resizePaneLeft)`
* `workbench.action.terminal.resizePaneRight`: `kb(workbench.action.terminal.resizePaneRight)`

## Source Control

### Editor change navigation

Two new actions let you navigate between active changes in the current file:

* **Move to Next Change** (`kb(workbench.action.editor.previousChange)`)
* **Move to Previous Change** (`kb(workbench.action.editor.nextChange)`)

## Debugging

### Breakpoint icons in BREAKPOINTS view

To more easily distinguish between different breakpoints, we have added icons to the **BREAKPOINTS** view. The icons reflect the type and state of the breakpoint and are the same as in the editor glyph margin. Active breakpoints are red, disabled gray and unverified have a hollow structure. Conditional breakpoints have an equality sign, while function breakpoints are represented with a triangle.

![Breakpoints](images/1_21/breakpoints.png)

### Node debugging

**Node Version Switcher "nvs" support**

Last milestone we've added support for the [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) ("nvm"). We now also support the [Node Version Switcher](https://github.com/jasongin/nvs) ("nvs"). Use the `runtimeVersion` attribute in a "node" launch configuration for selecting a specific version of Node.js.

**Note**: Make sure you have the Node.js version installed that you want to use with the `runtimeVersion` attribute as VS Code will not download and install the version automatically. For example, run something like `nvs add 7.10.1` from the Integrated Terminal if you plan to add `"runtimeVersion": "7.10.1"` to your launch configuration.

**Note**: If VS Code detects that "nvs" is installed, it does **not** fall back to "nvm" if a specific Node.js version cannot be found in "nvs". Using both "nvs" and "nvm" at the same time is not supported.

## Extensions

### Manage built-In extensions

With this release, you can now manage (disable/enable) the built-in extensions shipped with VS Code. There is an action **Show Built-in Actions** in Extensions view that shows all built-in extensions and you can browse and manage them.

![Manage Built-in](images/1_21/manage-builtin.gif)

## Language Packs

In 1.20 we added support for language packs and now the first language packs are available in the [Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?term=%22language%20pack%20extension%20for%22&target=VSCode&category=All%20categories&sortBy=Relevance). We will continue to work with the community to add more language packs.

## Extension Authoring

### Add, remove and change workspace folders

The [previously proposed](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_20#_add-remove-and-change-workspace-folders) API for adding, removing and changing workspace folders has been promoted to Stable.

### Messages: `isCloseAffordance` no longer supported for non-modal messages

With the introduction of a new notification UI in this milestone, every notification message now provides a close button in the top-right corner. This change means that the close action is no longer mixed with other message actions and `isCloseAffordance` is no longer be needed for messages that are non-modal. Please look at your message usage and make sure that you are not adding an action to close the notification unless that action is doing something specific for your extension.

A message will still close automatically if any of the provided actions is clicked by the user.

### Folding

New proposed API has been added to support language aware folding:

```ts
export namespace languages {

    /**
     * Register a folding provider.
     *
     * @param selector A selector that defines the documents this provider is applicable to.
     * @param provider A folding provider.
     * @return A [disposable](#Disposable) that unregisters this provider when being disposed.
     */
    export function registerFoldingProvider(selector: DocumentSelector, provider: FoldingProvider): Disposable;
```

This is still work in progress, but feedback is welcome.

### New theme colors and removal of old colors

With the new notifications UX, new colors were added that theme authors should adopt:

* `notificationCenter.border`: Notification Center border color.
* `notificationCenterHeader.foreground`: Notification Center header foreground color.
* `notificationCenterHeader.background`: Notification Center header background color.
* `notificationToast.border`: Notification toast border color.
* `notifications.foreground`: Notifications foreground color.
* `notifications.background`: Notifications background color.
* `notifications.border`: Notifications border color separating from other notifications in the Notification Center.
* `notificationLink.foreground`: Notification links foreground color.

All of the previously supported theme colors for notifications are no longer supported.

The border color of editor highlights can now also be freely chosen:

* `editor.selectionHighlightBorder`: Border color for regions with the same content as the selection.
* `editor.wordHighlightBorder`: Border color of a symbol during read-access, for example when reading a variable.
* `editor.wordHighlightStrongBorder`: Border color of a symbol during write-access, for example when writing to a variable.
* `editor.findMatchBorder`: Border color of the current search match.
* `editor.findMatchHighlightBorder`: Border color of the other search matches.
* `editor.findRangeHighlightBorder`: Border color the range limiting the search (Enable 'Find in Selection' in the find widget).
* `editor.rangeHighlightBorder`: Background color of the border around highlighted ranges.

These additional colors were also added

* `terminal.border`: The color of the border that separates split panes within the terminal. This defaults to panel.border.

### Custom views

**Proposed API: Reveal**

A new proposed API was added to reveal and select an item in the view. You can access this API from `TreeView` object that is returned when you register the `TreeDataProvider`.

```typescript
const customView = vscode.window.registerTreeDataProvider<string>('customView', new CustomViewDataProvider<string>());
customView.reveal('element');
```

By default the item to be revealed is selected. In order to not to select, set the option `select` to `false`. For example:

```js
  customView.reveal('element', {select: false});
```

More examples are [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-extension-samples/blob/master/tree-view-sample/src/ftpExplorer.fileSystemProvider.ts#L2).

**NOTE:** To access this API, registered `TreeDataProvider` is required to implement `getParent` method .

**Themable item icons**

If you want your `TreeItem` to have a folder or file icon from the active File Icon theme, you can assign the `iconPath` property of `TreeIem` to the `ThemeIcon.Folder` or `ThemeIcon.File` constant.

**Tooltips**

You can provide a tooltip to an item in the view using the property `tooltip` in `TreeItem`.

### Extension uninstall hook

If your extension has some clean ups to be done when it is uninstalled from VS Code, you can now do that by registering a `node` script to the uninstall hook `vscode:uninstall` under `scripts` section in extension's `package.json`.

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "vscode:uninstall": "node ./out/src/lifecycle"
  }
}
```

This script gets executed when the extension is completely uninstalled from VS Code which is when VS Code is restarted (shutdown and start) after the extension is uninstalled.

**NOTE:** Only Node.js scripts are supported.

### Active view context key

There's a new keybinding context key ('when' clause) available which uses the ID of the currently open view: `activeViewlet`. Example usage:

```json
  "when": "activeViewlet == workbench.view.scm"
```

### Debug Adapter Protocol

**New `CapabilitiesEvent`**

Sometimes it is difficult for a debug adapter to know and return all capabilities from the (very early) `Initialize` request because some might not be known until the runtime/debugger has started. The newly introduced `CapabilitiesEvent` can be used at a later time to announce that one or more capabilities have changed. Since the capabilities are dependent on the frontend and its UI, it might not be possible to change that at random times (or too late). Consequently, the `CapabilitiesEvent` has a hint characteristic: a frontend can only be expected to make a 'best effort' in honoring individual capabilities, but there are no guarantees.

### Language Server Protocol

Version 3.6.0 of the [protocol specification](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specification) is released. The version specifies the following new requests and notifications:

* [Get Workspace Folders](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specification#workspace_workspaceFolders)
* [DidChangeWorkspaceFolders Notification](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specification#workspace_didChangeWorkspaceFolders)
* [Get Configuration](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specification#workspace_configuration)
* [Goto Type Definition](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specification#textDocument_typeDefinition)
* [Goto Implementataion](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specification#textDocument_implementation)
* [Document Color](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specification#textDocument_documentColor)
* [Color Presentation](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specification#textDocument_colorPresentation)

## Engineering

### Duplicate issue detection

The issue bot and the issue reporter UI run the new issue through duplicate detection and suggest candidates of existing issues.

![Duplicate Detection by Issue Bot](images/1_21/issue-bot-duplicate-detection.png)

### Issue bot configuration by development phase

The issue bot changes its configuration depending on the current development phase. The change between development phases is set up ahead of time in the repository at `.github/calendar.yml` ([example](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/.github/calendar.yml)).

## New Commands

Key|Command|Command id
---|-------|----------
`kb(notifications.showList)`|Show the Notification Center|`notifications.showList`
`kb(notifications.hideList)`|Hide the Notification Center|`notifications.hideList`
`kb(notifications.toggleList)`|Toggle the visibility of the Notification Center|`notifications.toggleList`
`kb(notifications.hideToasts)`|Hide notification toasts|`notifications.hideToasts`
`kb(notifications.focusToasts)`|Focus first notification toast|`notifications.focusToasts`
`kb(notifications.focusNextToast)`|Focus next notification toast|`notifications.focusNextToast`

`kb(workbench.action.reloadWindowWithExtensionsDisabled)`|Reload window with extensions disabled|`workbench.action.reloadWindowWithExtensionsDisabled`

With the new notification commands, there are also new contexts for keybindings:

* `notificationFocus`: when a notification has keyboard focus (either as toast or in the Notification Center)
* `notificationCenterVisible`: when the Notification Center is visible
* `notificationToastsVisible`: when a notification toast is visible

Note that notification toasts are never displayed when the notification Center is visible.
