## Insiders Release

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the September 1.28 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll see details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the September release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[September Iteration Plan](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/58224)** - See what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit Log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/75?closed=1)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the September milestone.

We really appreciate people taking a look at our new features as soon as they are ready so check back here often and learn what's new to try out.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the VS Code repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues).

## Issue Grooming

As announced on the [September iteration plan](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/58224) we focussed on housekeeping our GitHub issues. Across all of our VS Code repositories, we closed (either triaged or fixed) **TBD** issues. While we closed issues, you created around **TBD** new issues. This resulted in a net reduction of around **TBD** issues. The the main [vscode repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues) now has **TBD** open feature requests and **TBD** open bugs.

It was great to see how much you care about our progress. Benjamin Lannon published a personal site with a [live tracker](https://vscode-issue-tracker.netlify.com/) of our issue numbers in our [main repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues). It shows nicely the progress we made over the three weeks:

![Burn down of issues](images/1_28/september-issue-grooming-1.png)

But it also shows what happens as soon as we start paying attention to more than just issue grooming and fixing. Below are the last three days of last week, and the picture tells you that there will be more issue grooming iterations in our future.

![Increase of issues](images/1_28/september-issue-grooming-2.png)

## Workbench

### Symbolic links support when opening folder

For a long time, VS Code has been resolving a symbolic link to a folder when opening. This meant, that even though the symbolic link was there for a reason, VS Code was ignoring it and always opened the resolved link path. We now have decided to change this behavior and preserve the symbolic link.

**Note:** Certain features will work with reduced functionality when opening a folder as a symbolic link (for example [debug](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/57954) and [Git](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5970)).

### File icons per file type

On macOS and Windows, VS Code registers as the default editor for well-known file types. VS Code now ships custom icons for the some of the common VS Code file types. These icons will show up in the OS explorer when the size of the icons is configured to be medium to large. For small icon sizes, we decided to preserve the VS Code logo as the icon.

![File Icons](images/1_28/file-icons.png)

### Record & Search Keybindings

Now you can search the keybindings just by typing them. Keyboard Shortcuts Editor has a recording mode in which you can type keybindings to search.

![Record Keybindings](images/1_28/record-keybindings.gif)

You can also enter into the recording mode using `kb(keybindings.editor.recordSearchKeys)` and `Esc` key exists from that mode.


### Toggle panel changes

We decided to revisit the behavior of our commands for toggling panels (Terminal, Output, Problems, Debug Console). You can follow [issue 19400](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/19400) for the background on the change.

The **old** behavior was:

* Panel shows if not visible.
* Panel hides if visible.

The **new** behavior is:

* Panel shows if not visible.
* Panel hides if having keyboard focus.
* Panel gets focused when visible but not focused.

To get back the previous behavior, you can configure a keybinding to close the panel when the related panel is active.

For example, for Output panel:

```json
{
    "key": "cmd+shift+u",
    "command": "workbench.action.closePanel",
    "when": "activePanel==workbench.panel.output"
}
```

The list of panel identifiers is:

* `workbench.panel.terminal`
* `workbench.panel.markers`
* `workbench.panel.output`
* `workbench.panel.repl`

### Copy Relative Path

The command to copy a file path as relative path is now more prominently exposed in the context menus of the File Explorer as well as editor tabs.

![Copy Relative Path](images/1_28/copy-relative-path.png)

### Exclude recently opened files from Quick Open

A new setting `search.quickOpen.includeHistory` allows you to control if files that were recently opened should be part of the Quick Open file picker. By default, files that were recently opened will appear to the top of the search and other files from the workspace below. If you would prefer to not see recently opened files on top, you can change this setting to `false`.

### Disable trash when deleting files

If you are seeing issues when deleting files from the Explorer by moving them to the OS trash, you can now set `files.enableTrash` to `false` to never use the OS trash when deleting. Doing so will change the **Delete** action and keybinding on the File Explorer to bypass the OS trash and delete permanently. You will still see a prompt before the delete happens.

### Prompt to open workspace file if detected

When opening a folder that contains one or more `.code-workspace` files in the root, VS Code now shows a notification to ask if you'd like to open the workspace file instead. Opening a workspace file will usually provide a much better experience than just opening the folder. You can learn more about multi-root workspaces in our [documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/multi-root-workspaces).

![Workspace Prompt](images/1_28/workspace-prompt.png)

### Do not restore view state when reopening a file

VS Code has always remembered the view state (cursor location, folding, etc.) of a file even after the file was closed. There is now a new setting `workbench.editor.restoreViewState` to drop this view state when a file is closed. This allows you to always start at the top of the file after reopening it.

### Close a file across all editor groups

A new command **Close Editor in all Groups** (`workbench.action.closeEditorInAllGroups`) allows you to close the currently active file across all editor groups.

### Project-level snippets

Snippets can now be scoped to a project and shared with your team. Simply use the **Preferences: Configure User Snippets** command or create `*.code-snippets` file in the `.vscode`. Project snippets work just like other snippets, they show up in IntelliSense and in the **Insert Snippet** action where they now have their own category.

![Project Level Snippet](images/1_28/project-snippet.jpg)

Snippets also now support multiple prefixes. If you cannot decide if your copyright-header-snippet should be prefixed as `header`, `stub`, or `copyright`, you can have them all. Simply use a string array as the `prefix` property.

```json
{
  "prefix": [ "header", "stub", "copyright"],
  "body": "Copyright. Foo Corp 2028",
  "description": "Adds copyright...",
  "scope": "javascript,typescript"
}
```

### Problems Panel

#### Problem Code

Problems panel now shows code of a problem if it has any.

![Problem code](images/1_28/problem-code.png)

#### Keyboard Friendly

Problems panel has become more keyboard friendly in this relase.

- You can start typing to filter when problems are focused.
- You can use `kb(problems.action.focusFilter)` to focus filter box from problems and `kb(problems.action.focusProblemsFromFilter)` to focus problems from the filter box.

### Output Panel

#### More Efficient

In this release we made Output panel more efficient by changing the transporation mechanism of output channel data. Extension host no longer forwards the appended output channel data to Output panel directly. It appends the data into a file and sends a signal to Output panel only if the channel is visible. Output panel updates the channel by listening to the signal. It means that Output channel does not cause any load on VS Code (UI) when it is not shown.

#### Dedicated channel for Telemetry

In the July 2018 release, we added a feature where all telemetry events sent by VS Code also get logged to a local file when you set the log level to trace using the `Developer: Set Log Level...` command. You can now view the contents of this file in the dedicated channel named `Log (Telemetry)` in the output panel. As before, you can view the file directly, using the `Developer: Open Log File...` command.

### Custom Views: Focus Commands

- You can now use commands to focus every custom view in VS Code. Each view has a separate command registered to focus itself.

![Custom View Focus Commands](images/1_28/custom-view-focus-commands.png)


### Change SCM commit keybinding

You can now change the default keybinding to accept a commit message in the SCM view, using the `scm.acceptInput` command.

### SCM status bar tracks active file

The SCM status bar contribution in the bottom left now tracks whichever repository the currently active file belongs to. This reduces confusion as you're editing files around your multi-folder workspace.

### Git Extension

#### Better handling of deletion conflicts

Deletion conflicts were always detected by VS Code. Now there is a better UI flow for handling them: you can see the undeleted version when opening the change and you get to decide what happens to the file when staging it: keep it or delete it.

![Tab Completion](images/1_28/deleted.gif)

#### Configure long git commit message warning length threshold

The `git.inputValidationLength` setting now lets you configure how long a commit message must be before a warning appears as you edit it.

#### Add folder to workspace after git init

After initializing a git repo, VS Code will now ask you whether you'd like to add it to the current workspace.

#### Configure branch validation rules

You can now control how branch name validation works with the powerful `git.branchValidationRegex` and `git.branchWhitespaceChar` settings. See https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/50241 for more details.

#### Always rebase when running Sync

The `git.rebaseWhenSync` setting will let you configure the Sync command to always use rebase instead of merge, when running.

#### Disable progress reporting

With the `git.showProgress` setting, you can now disable showing progress during Git operations.

#### Push --force

There are times in your development day-to-day in which you just feel like taking a risk. Running `git push --force` is a great example! VS Code now lets you forcefully push commits to a remote without the need to go into a terminal. Use the `git.allowForcePush`, `git.useForcePushWithLease` and `git.confirmForcePush` settings to control this behavior. See https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pull/53286 for more details.

#### Stash Apply

The following `git stash apply` commands are now featured in the global command palette: `Git: Apply Stash...`, `Git: Apply Latest Stash`.

#### Always visible `Staged Changes` section

You can now always keep the `Staged Changes` section visible in the SCM view, even when empty, using the `git.alwaysShowStagedChangesResourceGroup` setting:

![Tab Completion](images/1_28/staged.png)

### Linux URL handling

Once a feature limited to Windows and macOS, now you can also open VS Code URLs on Linux! These URLs are useful for many different features such as automatically installing extensions, eg. `vscode-insiders:extension/vscodevim.vim`.

## Editor

### Tab Completion

Editor Tab completion can now complete all kind of suggestions. Use `"editor.tabCompletion": "on"` and pressing `kbstyle(Tab)` will complete any prefix, not just snippets. Also, pressing `kb(insertNextSuggestion)` will insert the next suggestion and `kb(insertPrevSuggestion)` will insert the previous suggestion.

![Tab Completion](images/1_28/tabcompletion.gif)

### IntelliSense locality bonus

Suggestions can now be sorted based on their distance to the cursor. Set `"editor.suggest.localityBonus": true` and you'll see, for example, function parameters showing up at the top of the IntelliSense list.

![Locality Bonus](images/1_28/locality-bonus.png)

### Navigate to last edit location

A new command **Go to Last Edit Location** (`workbench.action.navigateToLastEditLocation`) was added to quickly navigate to the last location in a file that was edited. The default keybinding is `kb(workbench.action.navigateToLastEditLocation)`.

### Save without formatters

The new command **Save without Formatting** (`workbench.action.files.saveWithoutFormatting`) can be used to save a file without triggering any of the save participants (for example, formatters, remove trailing whitespace, final newline). The default keybinding is `kb(workbench.action.files.saveWithoutFormatting)`.

### Emmet

We have made a few improvements to the Emmet features this iteration:

- If you have enabled emmet in javascript files, then you can now have emmet abbreviation expansion inside the `<script>` tags in an html file.
- The `Emmet: Wrap with Abbreviation` feature is no longer restricted to files with the `.html` extension.
- The `Emmet: Balance (inward)` feature now works on current node even if there is no selection.
- The [bug](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/56082) of wrongfully considering css selectors with a `#` in scss files as valid abbreviations is now fixed.

## Extensions

- You can now use the `@category` filter along with filters for installed extensions like `@installed`, `@enabled`, `@disabled` and `@outdated` to compose your extension search query. This enables you to search for say installed themes using the query `@installed @category:themes` or installed extensions that contribute snippets using `@installed @category:snippets`.
- The badge on the Activity Bar for Extensions that shows count of outdated extensions will now exclude disabled extensions. The intention of this badge was to let you know that there are outdated extensions that you may want to update. Since one disables extensions that are not wanted at the moment, including them in the count would only be a distraction.

## Preview Features

Preview features are not ready for release but are functional enough to use. We welcome your early feedback while they are under development.

### Continued Electron 3.0 exploration

During this milestone, we continued to explore bundling Electron 3.0.0 into VS Code. This is a major Electron release and comes with Chrome 66 and Node.js 10.x (a major leap forward compared to our current version that has Chrome 61 and Node.js 8.x). We plan to push out the update to our Insiders users in the near future to gather additional feedback. If you are interested in helping out, make sure to install VS Code [Insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders).

## Extension Authoring

### Handling URLs for uninstalled extensions

[Back in July](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_26#_uri-handler-api) we released the URI Handler API for extensions to handle system-wide URIs. With the latest release, VS Code can even handle URIs for extensions which are not yet installed. Once a user opens such a URI, VS Code will search for the extension in the Marketplace, propose the user to install it, activate it and pass the URI along to it. This allows extensions to have a smooth startup flow which takes users from a webpage to running the extension with certain state.

### Diagnostic Code

Since diagnostic codes are now surfaced in [Problems Panel](#problem-code), it is no longer necessary for the extensions to add them to the [`Diagnostic.message`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/vscode.d.ts#L4074) property.

### Better configuration when clauses

When authoring keybindings or menu visibility, [when](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings#_when-clause-contexts) clauses are used. In a when clause, you can reference a configuration (setting) value by prefixing it with `config.`, for example `config.editor.tabCompletion`. Only boolean configuration properties had been supported but with this release, you can also use string and number values.

### Change the language of a text document

There is a new API function to change the language mode of a document, `vscode.languages.setTextDocumentLanguage`. The API takes a document and the language [identifier](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/overview#_language-id) you want to use. To know what language ids are available, use `vscode.languages.getLanguages`.

### New theme colors

There are new theme colors:

* `menu.separatorBackground`: Color of a separator menu item in menus.
* `sideBarSectionHeader.border`: Side bar section header border color.
* `inputValidation.infoForeground`: Input validation foreground color for information severity.
* `inputValidation.warningForeground`: Input validation foreground color for warning severity.
* `inputValidation.errorForeground`: Input validation foreground color for error severity.
* `editor.snippetTabstopHighlightBackground`: Highlight background color of a snippet tabstop.
* `editor.snippetTabstopHighlightBorder`: Highlight border color of a snippet tabstop.
* `editor.snippetFinalTabstopHighlightBackground`: Highlight background color of the final tabstop of a snippet.
* `editor.snippetFinalTabstopHighlightBorder`: Highlight border color of the final tabstop of a snippet.
* `activityBar.inactiveForeground`: Activity bar item foreground color when it is inactive.

### Debug API

**`resolveDebugConfiguration` needs to explicitly return `null` to open `launch.json`**

Previously, if `resolveDebugConfiguration` returned a launch configuration that did not have a `type` attribute, VS Code would automatically open an underlying `launch.json` file. After feedback from extension authors, we decided to give extensions more control over this scenario.

Now `resolveDebugConfiguration` has to explicitly return the value `null` to prevent the debug session from starting and open `launch.json` instead. Returning the value `undefined` simply prevents the debug session from starting. As before, returning a configuration with a `type` attribute will start a debug session.

## Proposed Extension APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always we are keen on your feedback. This is what you have to do to try out a proposed API:

* You must use Insiders because proposed APIs change frequently.
* You must have this line in the `package.json` file of your extension: `"enableProposedApi": true`.
* Copy the latest version of the [`vscode.proposed.d.ts`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/vscode.proposed.d.ts) file into your project.

Note that you cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. We may likely make breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.

### Debug API

**new `DebugConfigurationProvider.provideDebugAdapter` replaces `DebugConfigurationProvider.debugAdapterExecutable` commands**

Some time ago we added the proposed API `DebugConfigurationProvider.debugAdapterExecutable` so that an extension can return a dynamically calculated path (and corresponding program arguments) for the debug adapter about to be launched by VS Code. In this milestone, we are revising the initial design based on the feedback received (for example [#45220](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/45220), [#56646](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/56646), [#57706](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/57706), [#54465](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/54465)).

The [new API method](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/513025ed9e97c2fc04721d435bd88e5b4a2269ad/src/vs/vscode.proposed.d.ts#L536-L558) is called `provideDebugAdapter` and now we pass in the debug session, the workspace folder, the executable information from the `package.json`, and the resolved launch config. With this information, an extension has the "full picture" when being asked for creating the debug adapter.

In addition, we are now supporting more ways for starting and connecting to the debug adapter implementation. For this, a descriptor object can be returned from the `provideDebugAdapter` method:

* A `DebugAdapterExecutable` descriptor can be used to launch the debug adapter as an external process per session and communicates with it via stdin/stdout. With the new API, it is now possible to specify the working directory and environment variables for the debug adapter.
* A `DebugAdapterServer` describes a server process that handles multiple sessions and communicates via a socket.
* A `DebugAdapterImplementation` can be used for an in-place implementation that induces no communication overhead. This option relies on a small modification to the [Node.js based client library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vscode-debugadapter) for DAP and is planned for October.

Please note that this is proposed API and cannot be used in extensions published on the Marketplace. However, we'd appreciate your feedback for `DebugConfigurationProvider.provideDebugAdapter` on issue [#45220](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/45220).

## Miscellaneous

### Blurriness on macOS Mojave

If you have updated to macOS 10.14 (Mojave), you might have noticed that fonts in VS Code look blurry if you are not using a high-DPI monitor.

A workaround for this is to run:

```bash
defaults write -g CGFontRenderingFontSmoothingDisabled -bool NO
```

from a terminal followed by restarting your computer.

Note that this change is global for every application and not specific to VS Code. See [issue 51132](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/51132) for the related discussion.

### Electron update

In this release, we updated from Electron 2.0.7 to 2.0.9. Most notably this allows VS Code to run again on ArchLinux ([issue 55934](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/55934)).

## New Commands

Key|Command|Command id
---|-------|----------
`kb(workbench.action.navigateToLastEditLocation)`|Navigate to the last location edited|`workbench.action.navigateToLastEditLocation`
`kb(workbench.action.files.saveWithoutFormatting)`|Save file without running save participants (formatters, etc.)|`workbench.action.files.saveWithoutFormatting`
`kb(workbench.action.closeEditorInAllGroups)`|Close the active file across all editor groups|`workbench.action.closeEditorInAllGroups`
`kb(toggle.diff.renderSideBySide)`|Toggle diff editor inline and side-by-side mode (deprecates `toggle.diff.editorMode`)|`toggle.diff.renderSideBySide`

## New Documentation

### GitHub Pull Request extension blog post

You can read Kenneth's recent [blog post](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2018/09/10/introducing-github-pullrequests) announcing the new [GitHub Pull Request](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github) extension and discussing the collaboration between VS Code and the GitHub Editor team.

### Using Azure Pipelines blog post

In [Visual Studio Code using Azure Pipelines](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2018/09/12/engineering-with-azure-pipelines), VS Code engineer João Moreno describes how VS Code is now using [Azure Pipelines](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2018/09/12/engineering-with-azure-pipelines) for its build and continuous integration (CI) infrastructure.

### New Python Django tutorial

There is a new [Use Django in Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/tutorial-django?utm_source=VsCode&utm_medium=ReleaseNotes) tutorial showing how you can quickly create, edit, and debug a Python [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) web application in VS Code.

### New PowerShell topic

[PowerShell in Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/powershell) shows the PowerShell integration through the Microsoft [PowerShell](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.PowerShell) extension. The extension supports powerful language features such as IntelliSense, Go to Definition, and Find All References as well as debugging and code snippets.
