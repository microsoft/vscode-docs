<!-- DOWNLOAD_LINKS_PLACEHOLDER -->

Welcome to the March 2024 release of Visual Studio Code. There are many updates in this version that we hope you'll like, some of the key highlights include:

* Highlight 1 goes here
* Highlight 2 goes here

>If you'd like to read release notes for previous VS Code versions, go to [Updates](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates) on [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com).

## Accessibility

### Voice recording sounds

A sound now indicates when voice recording starts and can be disabled with the `accessibility.signals.voiceRecordingStarted` setting.

A sound to indicate when the recording stops can be configured with the `accessibility.signals.voiceRecordingStopped` setting.

### Improved diff editor accessibility

If you're using a screen reader, you now get an announcement when a diff editor becomes the active editor. You can disable this behavior with the `accessibility.verbosity.diffEditorActive` setting.

We also added information about **Diff Editor: Switch Side**, a helpful command for keyboard users, to the [accessibility help dialog](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/accessibility#_accessibility-help).

[Accessibility Signals](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/accessibility#_accessibility-signals) now work on both sides of the diff editor. Previously, they were only available on the modified side.

### Accessible view chat code block commands

When you inspect a chat response in the Accessible View, you can now use the code block commands and keybindings that are available in the Chat view.

These include **Chat: Insert at Cursor**, **Chat: Insert into Terminal** and **Chat: Insert into New File**.

### Notebook cell aria label updates

Aria labels for notebook cells now update to inform you if the cell is currently executing or pending execution.

## Workbench

### Custom editors support in floating windows

We expanded support for opening editors into [floating windows](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/custom-layout#_floating-editor-windows) to custom editors, and generally all editors that leverage the [webview API](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/webview). This includes markdown preview, browser preview, and complex custom editors, such as our [hex editor](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.hexeditor).

<video src="images/1_88/custom-editors-float.mp4" title="Custom editors support in floating windows." autoplay loop controls muted></video>

**Note:** due to a technical limitation, moving a webview based editor between windows requires the contents of that editor to reload. It is then up to the editor to restore the state you had previously accumulated. In some cases your state might be reset, as if you had opened the editor for the first time.

### Search Editor single-click behavior

You can now configure the <code codesetting="search.searchEditor.singleClickBehaviour">search.searchEditor.singleClickBehaviour</code> setting to determine what happens when you single-click on a Search Editor entry. Currently, the setting only supports opening a Peek Definition.

### Quick Search improvements

#### Sticky file paths

In Quick Search, we've made the file name separators sticky to make it clearer which file a search result is associated with. This can be useful when you have many occurrences of a search term in a file.

<video src="images/1_88/quick-pick-sticky-scroll.mp4" title="Sticky scroll support in the quick pick" autoplay loop controls muted></video>

#### File path separator buttons

Whether you hover into file results of a particular file, or if you arrow down to a result, the buttons also appear for the file path separator.

<video src="images/1_88/quick-pick-separator-buttons-show-up.mp4" title="Separator buttons show up when you hover or focus an item in that section" autoplay loop controls muted></video>

### Quick Pick separator navigation keybindings

We received feedback that it would be nice to be able to navigate between separators in a quick pick. This iteration we've added a keybinding to do just this. On Windows & Linux you can use `Alt+Up/Down`, and on macOS it is `Cmd+Up/Down`. In this example video, you can see the active item moving between:

* The `recently used` and `other commands` separators in the Command Palette
* Between the file path separators in Quick Search

<video src="images/1_88/quick-pick-separator-keybindings.mp4" title="Move between separators using keybindings" autoplay loop controls muted></video>

### Quick Pick disabled checkbox items

This iteration, we made it clearer when a quick pick wants to display items that are disabled. An example of this can be found in the "Managed Trusted Extensions" quick pick, which can be accessed for any of the accounts that you're logged in to.

![The Managed Trusted Extensions quick pick with some items disabled](images/1_88/manage-trusted-extensions.png)

## Editor

### Refactor Preview keybindings

When using Rename Symbols (when Copilot is enabled, it prompts Copilot Rename Suggestions), accessible via `kbstyle(F1)`, the keybinding for previewing edits has been updated to `CtrlCmd + Enter` (previously `Shift + Enter`) to maintain consistency with previewing refactorings in other contexts, such as Code Actions.

When hovering over a Code Actions, `CtrlCmd + Enter` also opens the Refactor Preview panel in the workbench.

## Source Control

### Incoming changes file decorations

To avoid potential conflicts when merging/rebasing changes from the remote, we now show file decorations for all files that have incoming changes which were fetched but not yet merged/rebased. To benefit from this functionality, you should have both <code codesetting="git.autofetch">git.autofetch</code> and <code codesetting="git.decorations.enabled">git.decorations.enabled</code> settings enabled.

![Source Control incoming changes file decorators in the explorer view and in the editor tabs](./images/1_88/scm-incoming-changes-decorators.png)

_Theme: [GitHub Sharp](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=joaomoreno.github-sharp-theme) (preview on [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev/editor/theme/joaomoreno.github-sharp-theme))_

## Terminal

### Shell integration in debug terminals

To provide enhanced functionality to the user and extensions, [shell integration](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/shell-integration) is now automatically enabled in terminals launched when debugging.

### Run recent command improvements

The shell integration-powered Run recent command (`kb(workbench.action.terminal.runRecentCommand)`) now scrolls to and displays the last time the command was run, where possible. Running the command or cancelling the quick pick returns the terminal to its previous state.

<video src="images/1_88/terminal-run-recent-command-preview.mp4" title="Running a recent command will preview the last time it's run in the terminal temporarily" autoplay loop controls muted></video>

_Theme: [Sapphire](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Tyriar.theme-sapphire) (preview on [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev/editor/theme/Tyriar.theme-sapphire))_

### Open detected link improvements

The Open detected link feature (`kb(workbench.action.terminal.openDetectedLink)`) now previews the link result in the editor underneath the link quick pick, and shows the link source in the terminal.

<video src="images/1_88/terminal-open-detected-link.mp4" title="Previews are shown in both the editor and terminal when scrolling through links" autoplay loop controls muted></video>

Additionally, duplicate links are now filtered out of the list and all links are presented in a consistent format.

![When 3 yarn.lock links are printed with the same line and column numbers, they will all be merged into a single detected link](./images/1_88/terminal-open-detected-link-format.png)

### Additional surrounding context used for word links

[Word links](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/basics#_links) are defined by the `terminal.integrated.wordSeparators` setting and are the fallback when files/folder/URIs cannot be found. When activated, these links now include additional surrounding context to add line and column information for the search that occurs.

Notice in the screenshot below that the link `terminalLinkParsing` was clicked, but the resulting search also includes the line number following the link:

![Activating a "terminalLinkParsing" link when followed by "line 24" will include the 24 line number in the search](./images/1_88/terminal-word-link-context.png)

### New link formats

The following link format is now detected in terminals, even if the path contains spaces:

- ` FILE  path:line:column`

### Terminal sticky scroll transparency support

[Sticky scroll in the terminal](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_85#_sticky-scroll) now supports transparency. A theme can use this by configuring the `terminalStickyScroll.background` theme color to a transparent value, or by specifying an override in your `settings.json`. For example:

```json
{
  "workbench.colorCustomizations": {
    "[Default Dark Modern]": {
      "terminalStickyScroll.background": "#181818c0"
    }
  }
}
```

Which gives:

![The sticky scroll background can now be transparent, allowing the text behind to bleed through](./images/1_88/terminal-sticky-scroll-transparent.png)

## Debug


## Testing

### Test Coverage

This iteration we've finalized our Test Coverage API, bringing native coverage support to VS Code. If your testing system supports it, you can get coverage by using the new **Run With Coverage** button:

![Screenshot showing the Run With Coverage button in the Test explorer view](./images/1_88/run-with-coverage.png)

There are similarly new keybindings for running with coverage, such as `kbstyle(Ctrl+; Ctrl+Shift+A)` to run all tests with coverage, and `kbstyle(Ctrl+; Ctrl+Shift+L)` to run your last set of tests with coverage.

Coverage information is shown as an overlay on line numbers by default, but you can **Toggle Inline Coverage** to see complete detailed information for your source files:

![Screenshot showing the Test Coverage view in the Test Explorer view and color overlays in the editor](./images/1_88/test-coverage.png)

_Theme: [Codesong](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=connor4312.codesong) (preview on [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev/editor/theme/connor4312.codesong))_

Using test coverage requires that your extension implements the new API. Some extensions, such as the [Test Runner for Java](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-test) and the [node:test runner](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=connor4312.nodejs-testing) already support it.

Extension authors can find more details about the Test Coverage API in the [Testing API documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/testing#test-coverage).

### Color code support in test messages

We now parse terminal color codes to colorize textual test messages, such as those displayed when a test fails, rather than displaying the raw 'unprintable' data codes.

## Languages

### TypeScript 5.4

VS Code now includes TypeScript 5.4. This major update brings new improvements to type-checking and IntelliSense, as well as several bug fixes. See the [TypeScript 5.4 release blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-5-4/) for more details.

### Smarter inserting of images and links in Markdown

When you drop or paste an image or file into a Markdown file, VS Code automatically inserts Markdown image or link syntax for it. We now also smartly disable this behavior when you insert into code blocks and other contexts that don't support Markdown syntax:

<video src="images/1_88/md-drop.mp4" title="Smartly dropping an image into a Markdown file. Markdown image syntax is inserted when it can be used, but not used in code blocks" autoplay loop controls muted></video>

You can always switch back to inserting the Markdown syntax using the drop/paste widget. You can also configure this behavior by using the `markdown.editor.drop.enabled` and `markdown.editor.filePaste.enabled` settings.

## Notebooks

### Keyboard shortcuts in Notebook outputs

We now support some of the standard keyboard shortcuts in notebook outputs.

* Output can be selected and copied with the keyboard with the `kbstyle(Ctrl+A)` and `kbstyle(Ctrl+C)` keybindings respectively.
* Scrollable outputs can be scrolled with the keyboard with the `kbstyle(Up)` and `kbstyle(Down)` keybindings respectively.
* Scrolling to the top and bottom of a scrollable output can be achieved with the keyboard with the `kbstyle(Ctrl+Home)` and `kbstyle(Ctrl+End)` keybindings respectively (`kbstyle(Cmd+Up)` and `kbstyle(Cmd+Down)` on macOS).
* Selecting output from the current selection point to the top or bottom of the output, can be achieved with the keyboard with the `kbstyle(Ctrl+Shift+Up)` and `kbstyle(Ctrl+Shift+End)` keybindings respectively (`kbstyle(Shift+Cmd+Up)` and `kbstyle(Shift+Cmd+Down)` on macOS).

#### Cell error diagnostics

An extension can now provide error details for a failed cell, so that an error diagnostic shows within the cell. While focused on the cell container, `notebook.cell.openFailureActions` (`kbstyle(ctrl+.)`) jumps to the quick actions menu for that error. The diagnostic only shows when an LLM is available to provide quick actions.

<video src="images/1_88/cell-error-diagnostics.mp4" title="Error diagnostics in cells at failure location" autoplay loop controls muted></video>

## Remote Development

The [Remote Development extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack), allow you to use a [Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers), remote machine via SSH or [Remote Tunnels](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/tunnels), or the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl) (WSL) as a full-featured development environment.

Highlights include:

- Restrict access to Dev Tunnels and port forwarding via group policies
- Exec server mode for SSH

You can learn more about these features in the [Remote Development release notes](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/blob/main/remote-release-notes/v1_88.md).

## Contributions to extensions

### VS Code Speech

#### Lazy activation

The extension now only activates when voice-to-text services are requested in VS Code. This ensures that the extension is not negatively impacting the extension host startup time.

#### New `auto` for `accessibility.voice.speechLanguage`

For the <code codesetting="accessibility.voice.speechLanguage">accessibility.voice.speechLanguage</code> setting, `auto` is the new default. In this mode, the VS Code speech extension uses the display language of VS Code and picks the right model, if it's supported.

### GitHub Copilot

#### Inline Chat improvements

Inline Chat now starts as a floating control, making it more lightweight. When a request has been made, it takes up more space between your code lines. We have also adjusted the rendering to be more consistent with other chat experiences, such as the Chat view or Quick Chat.

![Inline Chat As Content Widget floating over the editor text](./images/1_88/inline-chat-content.png)
_Theme: [GitHub Light Colorblind (Beta)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme)_

We've repositioned the voting and rerun controls, and made the toggle control for viewing diffs more prominent alongside the Accept and Discard buttons.

![](./images/1_88/inline-chat-convo.png)
_Theme: [GitHub Light Colorblind (Beta)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme)_

#### Notebook kernel states as context

When you are in a notebook, the kernel state (for example, variables and available packages) is now included as context in the Inline Chat. This lets Copilot use the current state of the notebook to provide more relevant completions.

<video src="images/1_88/notebook-kernel-context.mp4" title="Notebook emebeds kernel state in context" autoplay loop controls muted></video>

_Theme: [GitHub Dark](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme)_

#### Commit message generation improvements

To improve the quality of the generated commit messages, we are now including as additional context the commit messages of the 10 most recent commits in the repository, and the commit messages of the 10 most recent commits of the current user.

#### @terminal /explain slash command

TODO: Tyriar - used by quick fix and explain selection

#### Preview: Terminal Inline Chat

TODO: Tyriar - includes voice support

Inline Chat for the terminal can be enabled with `terminal.integrated.experimentalInlineChat` and invoked in a terminal (`kb(inlinechat.start)`).

The terminal Inline Chat uses the `@terminal` chat participant, which has context about the integrated terminal shell and its contents.

#### Clarity on authentication flow

Clarity around authentication is very important. We want to be clear about how we authenticate and what we ask for. If you open a private repository in VS Code, and we don't have the right authentication for this scenario, we present an authentication dialog. The dialog has a description of why authentication is needed, and a "learn more" button to find out more about these requirements.

![a modal with learn more](images/1_88/learnmoreauth.png)

The "learn more" button takes you to our [documentation on authentication requirements](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-copilot-release/blob/a032cf75104a99ca745118ca51ea77219441a898/docs/copilot-repo-scope.md).

#### Variable references

Previously, the "Used References" section only showed context that was pulled in implicitly. Now, it also shows variables, such as `#file`, that were used explicitly, and indicate the name of the variable that included the reference. If a variable is missing from the "Used References" section, it may have been too large and didn't fit into the context window for the lanugage model.

![a file variable reference](images/1_88/chat-variable-reference.png)

#### Secondary chat submit actions

The chat submit button now has a dropdown for easy access to some additional actions.

- "Send to @workspace" submits your query to the `@workspace` chat participant
- "Send to New Chat" starts a new empty chat, then submits the query

### Python

#### Improved Debug config selection for Flask and Django

Creating launch configurations for Flask and Django apps just got easier! Improvements have been made to detect possible startup files in the workspace. For Django, the Python Debugger extension looks for `manage.py` or `app.py` files in the root or a subdirectory one level lower in your workspace. For Flask, the extension looks for `wsgi.py`, `app.py`, or `init.py` files with the declaration of a Flask application (i.e. `app = Flask(`). Note, if those files are not found in the project, the dropdown will show a **Default** option for the corresponding project type even though that file may not be present.

In the case your file was not detected, you can enter the file path directly or browse other files in your directory.

#### Hatch environment discovery

Working with Hatch environments is now easier in the Python extension! Hatch environments are now discovered and activated similar to other environments such as Venv, Conda, and Poetry. Furthermore, in the case of Hatch where an explicit environment identifier is not registered, the extension is able to determine the environment type (Hatch) from the environment locator.

#### Automatic environment selection for various environment management tools

If your workspace contains a pipenv, pyenv, or Poetry environments, the corresponding environment is now auto-selected for your workspace. Previously, the extension correctly discovered and identified these environments, but auto-selected the default global interpreter requiring you to manually select the appropriate environment for your workspace. Now, the Python extension infers the activated environments based on the prescense of the environments and any corresponding configuration files. For example, in the case of pyenv, the extension looks to the `.python-version` file to auto-select the appropriate interpreter for the workspace.

#### Report Issue Command Improvements

The [Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) and [Python Debugger](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.debugpy) extensions have adopted changes made to the `Help: Report Issue` API, making it easier for you to report issues to our repos! Filing an issue through the Report Issue command (`workbench.action.openIssueReporter`) does much of the heavy lifting and prompts you for details so that our team can most efficiently triage the problem you are encountering. To file an issue using the Report Issue command for [@vscode-python](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-python) or [@vscode-python-debugger](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-python-debugger), choose **Python** or **Python Debugger** respectively from the Extension dropdown.

### GitHub Pull Requests and Issues

### Jupyter

#### Cell execution analysis improvements

With the latest Pylance prerelease, we have better dependency analysis for Jupyter cells. It now understands module imports, which is especially useful when you have a cell that imports a module that was defined in a previous cell.

<video src="images/1_88/run-precedent-cells.mp4" autoplay loop controls muted title="Run Precedent Cells"></video>

To enable this feature, you need to install the latest [Pylance](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.vscode-pylance) prerelease in VS Code Insiders and enable setting the `jupyter.executionAnalysis.enabled` and the `notebook.consolidatedRunButton`.

## Extension Authoring

### Utilize Issue Reporter Command for Extension Bug Reporting

Last iteration, we finalized a way for extensions to contribute additional data or templates to fill out when submitting to GitHub via VS Code's Issue Reporter. Extensions can contribute a command which can be accessed via `Help: Report Issue...`. Selecting their extension will run their contributed command. Please review our [issue reporting documentation/release notes](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_87#_contributing-additional-data-in-issue-reporter) for more information on how this can work with your extension!

Additionally, all installed extensions can be quickly reported on via quick access. By typing `issue ` in the quick access, users can quickly select or search for an installed extension to report on.

Certain extensions will start moving over to utilizing this new issue reporting flow and will no longer need custom `Report Issue...` commands that are contributed directly into the command palette.

## Preview Features

### Rescaling overlapping glyph in the terminal

A new setting `terminal.integrated.rescaleOverlappingGlyphs` is available which will rescale glyphs that overlap following cells. This is intented to cover ambiguous width characters which may have font glyphs that don't match that of what the backing pty/unicode version thinks it is. For example in most fonts the roman numeral unicode characters (`U+2160+`) will typically take up multiple cells, so they will be rescaled horizontally when this setting is enabled.

![Before the glyphs for Ⅷ and Ⅻ depending on the font would always overlap the following cells](images/1_88/terminal-glyphs-before.png)

![After the glyphs for Ⅷ and Ⅻ depending on the font are rescaled horizontally to fit a single cell](images/1_88/terminal-glyphs-after.png)

The rules for when rescaling happens are still being tweaked and we are considering enabling this by default in the future when it's solid. If you try this out and see characters that are being rescaled but should not be, please [create an issue](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/new/choose).

## Proposed APIs

### Terminal shell integration API

A new proposed API is available which allows accessing some of the information provided by shell integration-activated terminals. With this API it will be possible to listen to the incoming data of commands being executed in the terminal as well as their exit codes. It will also introduces a more reliable way to execute commands that will wait for the prompt to be available before sending the command which helps fix some conflicts/race conditions that can occur with various shell set ups.

Here's an example of using the `Terminal.shellIntegration.executeCommand` proposal:

```ts
// Execute a command in a terminal immediately after being created
const myTerm = window.createTerminal();
window.onDidActivateTerminalShellIntegration(async ({ terminal, shellIntegration }) => {
  if (terminal === myTerm) {
    const command = shellIntegration.executeCommand('echo "Hello world"');
    const code = await command.exitCode;
    console.log(`Command exited with code ${code}`);
  }
}));

// Fallback to sendText if there is no shell integration within 3 seconds of launching
setTimeout(() => {
  if (!myTerm.shellIntegration) {
    myTerm.sendText('echo "Hello world"');
    // Without shell integration, we can't know when the command has finished or what the
    // exit code was.
  }
}, 3000);
```

Here's an example of listening to the data stream of a command:

```ts
// Create a terminal and log all data via console.log
const myTerm = window.createTerminal();
window.onDidStartTerminalShellExecution(execution => {
  if (execution.terminal === myTerm) {
    const stream = execution.createDataStream();
    for await (const data of stream) {
      console.log(data);
    }
  }
});
```

You can review the new API [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/main/src/vscode-dts/vscode.proposed.terminalShellIntegration.d.ts).

### "Learn More" property for authentication API

This iteration, we added a new proposed API that allows you to specify a `learnMore` property in `AuthenticationForceNewSessionOptions`. The idea here that if you call `getSession` with a `forceNewSession` property in the options, you can include a `URI` that would be presented to the user to learn more about why you're asking for auth. Here's an example of what that looks like:

![learn more](images/1_88/learnmoreauth.png)

Here's what that looks like in code:

```ts
vscode.authentication.getSession('github', ['repo'], {
  forceNewSession: {
    detail: l10n.t('To show you more relevant Copilot Chat results, we need permission to read the contents of your repository on GitHub.'),
    learnMore: Uri.parse('https://aka.ms/copilotRepoScope')
  };
});
```

You can review the new API [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/038cbaa25d4c61c4c76e50e299a72a055466e745/src/vscode-dts/vscode.proposed.authLearnMore.d.ts).
