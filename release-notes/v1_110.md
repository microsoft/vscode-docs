## February 5, 2026

* Add setting to control the scroll behavior in the Settings editor, offering continuous or paginated. Paginated will restrict the settings shown to only those in that category. [#291391](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/291391)

## February 4, 2026

* Improved chat `askQuestion` carousel now has improved accessibility. ARIA labels have been added, keyboard focus can be moved to the container, and focus no longer automatically moves to the first response. A new command and keybinding is available to focus the first response in screen reader mode. [#292917](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/292917)

* Add support for the text blink attribute in the integrated terminal. [#292550](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/292550)

* Add support for color scheme reporting in the integrated terminal, allowing programs to query the terminal's current color palette. [#290919](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/290919)

* Populate the Find control input in the integrated browser's with the currently selected text on the page, matching standard browser behavior. [#291378](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/291378)

* Show download progress information when downloading a VS Code update. [#277330](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/277330)

## February 3, 2026

* Terminal performance has been improved with updates to xterm.js, including optimizations for rendering and processing. [#292572](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/292572)

* Respect session list filters in the agent sessions Quick Pick and welcome page. If you have specific agent types filtered out from the session list, they will also be excluded from the Quick Pick when switching sessions. [#291603](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/291603)

## February 2, 2026

* Improved screen reader accessibility for quick input dialogs. ARIA attributes are now dynamically set only when the list is active, preventing redundant announcements. The Go to Line dialog (`Ctrl+G`) now provides proper screen reader announcements for characters typed and list item navigation. [#292353](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/292353)

* Selecting `Hidden terminal` in the terminal dropdown now directly opens the terminal when there is only one hidden terminal, instead of showing a quick pick menu. [#291884](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/291884)

* Fixed an issue where the terminal output panel in chat would auto-collapse on command success even when manually expanded. The panel now respects the user's manual expand state and remains expanded after successful command completion. [#291120](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/291120)

## January 30, 2026

* The chat question carousel UI now uses a list-style selection interface similar to QuickPick instead of native radio buttons and checkboxes. This provides better visual consistency with other VS Code selection UIs across platforms. [#291328](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/291328)
