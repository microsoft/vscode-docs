## February 3, 2026

* Terminal performance has been improved with updates to xterm.js, including optimizations for rendering and processing. [#292572](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/292572)

* The agent sessions quick pick and welcome page now respect session list filters. If you have specific agent types filtered out from the session list, they will also be excluded from the quick pick when switching sessions. [#291603](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/291603)

## February 2, 2026

* Improved screen reader accessibility for quick input dialogs. ARIA attributes are now dynamically set only when the list is active, preventing redundant announcements. The Go to Line dialog (`Ctrl+G`) now provides proper screen reader announcements for characters typed and list item navigation. [#292353](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/292353)

* Selecting `Hidden terminal` in the terminal dropdown now directly opens the terminal when there is only one hidden terminal, instead of showing a quick pick menu. [#291884](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/291884)

* Fixed an issue where the terminal output panel in chat would auto-collapse on command success even when manually expanded. The panel now respects the user's manual expand state and remains expanded after successful command completion. [#291120](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/291120)

## January 30, 2026

* The chat question carousel UI now uses a list-style selection interface similar to QuickPick instead of native radio buttons and checkboxes. This provides better visual consistency with other VS Code selection UIs across platforms. [#291328](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/291328)
