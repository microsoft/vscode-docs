## Agents


## Chat

### Auto-approve URLs in fetch tool

When using the fetch tool in chat, URLs that you explicitly mention in your chat message are now automatically approved without requiring additional confirmation. For example, if you ask "fetch `https://example.com`", the URL will be auto-approved since you explicitly included it in your request. This streamlines the workflow while maintaining security for URLs that are generated by the model or come from other sources.

[Issue #276955](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/276955)

### Keyboard shortcut for terminal output monitor

Added keyboard shortcut support (`Cmd/Ctrl+Enter`) for the "Wait for Task" confirmation when the terminal output monitor detects that a command requires user input. This makes it faster to confirm actions without requiring mouse interaction.

[Issue #276833](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/276833)

### Terminal command output persistence

Command output from the run in terminal tool is now serialized and persists even after the terminal is closed. This allows you to toggle and view command output in the chat interface even when the associated terminal is no longer active.

[Issue #274870](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/274870)

### Diff preview for sensitive file edits

When chat requests permission to edit sensitive files (such as `package.json`), the changes are now displayed as a diff preview instead of raw JSON. This makes it much easier to review and understand proposed modifications before approving them.

[Issue #266574](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/266574)


## MCP

### Support for HTTPS resource URIs

MCP resources can now use `https://` scheme URIs to reference web-hosted content. This reduces context size by allowing resources to be fetched on-demand rather than requiring all content to be embedded as blobs.

[Issue #259253](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/259253)

### Custom User-Agent headers

MCP server requests now include a proper User-Agent header in the format `VSCode/x.x.x (platform arch)` instead of just `node`. This enables MCP servers to identify VS Code traffic, improving analytics, debugging, and client-specific compatibility handling.

[Issue #264502](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/264502)


## Accessibility

### Accessible terminal inline output

Terminal inline output is now accessible to screen readers. The content is rendered as text in screen reader mode, ensuring that users relying on assistive technology can access terminal output information.

[Issue #274220](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/274220)

### Keybindings for chat terminal output

You can now configure custom keybindings to focus the chat terminal and to focus/expand the last chat terminal output. This improves keyboard navigation for users who prefer or require keyboard-only workflows.

[Issue #274411](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/274411)


## Editor Experience

### Create new group when moving editor to previous group

The "Move Editor into Previous Group" command now creates a new editor group to the left when invoked from the leftmost group (provided there are multiple editors in the group). This mirrors the existing behavior of "Move Editor into Next Group" and makes editor arrangement more consistent and intuitive.

[Issue #262817](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/262817)

### Recently opened indicator for active windows

The recently opened folders/workspaces picker now indicates which entries are already open in other windows, making it easier to identify and avoid opening duplicate instances of the same workspace.

[Issue #276460](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/276460)

### Swipe to navigate on macOS

The `workbench.editor.swipeToNavigate` setting has been reinstated for macOS, allowing you to use trackpad swipe gestures to navigate backward and forward through editor history, consistent with native macOS navigation patterns.

[Issue #204812](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/204812)

### AI-powered code actions

AI-related code actions are now shown in the Quick Fix menu (`Ctrl/Cmd+.`) out of the box, even without extensions installed. This provides easier access to AI features directly from the editor context.

[Issue #260136](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/260136)

### Wildcard support in Settings editor search

The Settings editor now supports wildcard patterns in ID-based searches. You can use queries like `@id:settingIdPrefix.*` to find all settings matching a prefix, making it easier to discover related settings.

[Issue #242231](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/242231)


## Code Editing

### Modifier key-only hover

A new `editor.hover.enabled` setting allows you to disable automatic hover while keeping modifier key hover (e.g., `Ctrl+hover`) enabled. This reduces hover popups during text selection while preserving on-demand hover information when needed.

[Issue #72025](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/72025)


## Notebooks


## Source Control

### Draft comment indicators in gutter

The editor gutter now displays a distinct draft icon for comment threads containing draft comments. This provides better visual feedback about the comment state directly in the editor, making it easier to identify unpublished review comments.

[Issue #179162](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/179162)


## Debugging


## Tasks


## Terminal

### Git Bash profile icon

The Git Bash terminal profile now includes a distinct icon on Windows, making it easier to visually identify Git Bash terminals among other shell profiles.

[Issue #275568](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/275568)

### Grouped argument suggestions

Terminal suggest now groups argument suggestions together, separate from options and flags. This improves the organization of completion suggestions and makes it easier to find the right argument when working with complex CLI commands.

[Issue #272352](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/272352)


## Authentication


## Languages


## Remote Development

The [Remote Development extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack), allow you to use a [Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers), remote machine via SSH or [Remote Tunnels](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/tunnels), or the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl) (WSL) as a full-featured development environment.

Highlights include:

* TODO: @ntrogh

You can learn more about these features in the [Remote Development release notes](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/blob/main/remote-release-notes/v1_107.md).
