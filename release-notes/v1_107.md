## Agents


## Chat

### Auto-approve URLs pasted in chat

URLs that are pasted directly into chat messages are now automatically approved without requiring additional user confirmation. This improvement recognizes that the act of pasting a URL into the chat demonstrates sufficient user intent to approve it.

[Issue #276955](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/276955)

### Keyboard shortcut for terminal task confirmation

Added keyboard shortcut support (`Cmd+Enter` / `Ctrl+Enter`) for confirming "wait for task" prompts in chat elicitation dialogs. This provides a consistent keyboard-driven workflow for responding to chat confirmations.

[Issue #276833](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/276833)

### Sensitive file edits displayed as diffs

When Copilot requests permission to edit sensitive files (like `package.json`), VS Code now displays an inline diff preview instead of raw JSON showing the `oldString` and `newString` values. This makes it easier to quickly understand the proposed changes before approving edits to protected files.

[Issue #266574](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/266574)

### AI code actions available out of the box

AI-related code actions are now available directly from VS Code's core interface without requiring the Copilot extension to be installed. These actions appear in the context menu (Ctrl/Cmd + .), diagnostic hovers, and quick fix menus, making AI capabilities more discoverable and accessible throughout the editor.

[Issue #260136](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/260136)



## MCP

### Proper User-Agent header for MCP requests

VS Code's Model Context Protocol (MCP) client now sends a proper User-Agent header (format: `VsCode/x.x.x (platform arch)`) instead of just `node`, enabling MCP servers to properly identify VS Code traffic in logs and analytics. This improves server compatibility, monitoring capabilities, and follows HTTP best practices.

[Issue #264502](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/264502)

### Support for HTTPS resources in MCP

VS Code now supports Model Context Protocol (MCP) resources using the `https://` URI scheme, allowing MCP servers to reference web-based resources like images without bloating the context with blob contents. This aligns with the MCP specification and enables more efficient resource handling for web-hosted content.

[Issue #259253](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/259253)


## Accessibility

### Terminal inline output accessible view

Terminal inline output is now accessible to screen reader users through a new accessible view. When inline terminal output is displayed, screen readers can access the content as plain text, making it easier to review command output and results without relying on visual presentation.

[Issue #274220](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/274220)

### Keybindings for chat terminal navigation

New keybinding actions are now available to focus the chat terminal and to focus or expand the last chat terminal output, improving keyboard navigation and accessibility for users interacting with chat-initiated terminal commands.

[Issue #274411](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/274411)



## Editor Experience

### Recently opened folders indicate open windows

The recently opened folders/workspaces picker now clearly indicates which entries are already open in another VS Code window, making it easier to avoid accidentally opening the same workspace multiple times.

[Issue #276460](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/276460)

### Move editor to previous group creates new group

The "Move Editor into Previous Group" command now creates a new editor group to the left when invoked from the leftmost group, mirroring the behavior of "Move Editor into Next Group" from the rightmost position. This simplifies editor arrangement workflows, particularly for keyboard and screen reader users.

[Issue #262817](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/262817)

### Draft comments shown in editor gutter

The editor gutter and Comments view now display a distinct draft comment icon (`comment-draft`) when a comment thread contains unpublished draft comments. This provides better visibility of draft comment states alongside the existing resolved and unresolved comment indicators, helping users identify which threads have pending changes during code reviews.

[Issue #179162](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/179162)

### Swipe navigation on macOS

Three-finger swipe gestures have been re-enabled on macOS to navigate between recently used editors. This feature was previously removed but has been reinstated using Electron's native swipe event support. Users must enable "Swipe with two or three fingers" in System Preferences > Trackpad > More Gestures for the gesture to work.

[Issue #204812](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/204812)

### Wildcard search in Settings editor

The Settings editor now supports wildcard patterns when searching by setting ID using the `@id:` filter. You can use patterns like `@id:settingIdPrefix.*` to match multiple related settings, making it easier to find and manage groups of configuration options with similar prefixes.

[Issue #242231](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/242231)



## Code Editing

### Modifier-only hover mode

The `editor.hover.enabled` setting has been expanded from a boolean to an enum with a new `onKeyboardModifier` option. When set to this mode, hover information only appears when holding a keyboard modifier key (Ctrl/Cmd or Alt, depending on your Multi Cursor Modifier setting), allowing users to disable automatic hover popups while still accessing hover information on demand.

[Issue #72025](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/72025)



## Notebooks


## Source Control



## Debugging


## Tasks


## Terminal

### Git Bash terminal icon

The Git Bash terminal profile on Windows now displays a dedicated icon in the terminal profile list, making it easier to visually identify among other shell options.

[Issue #275568](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/275568)

### Persistent terminal command output

Terminal command output executed via the chat "run in terminal" tool is now persisted and can be viewed even after the terminal has been closed. The output is serialized and stored in the tool's data, allowing you to toggle the "show output" action without keeping the terminal alive.

[Issue #274870](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/274870)

### Grouped argument suggestions

Terminal suggestions now group command arguments separately from flags and options for better organization. This improvement makes it easier to find relevant argument suggestions without them being mixed with command flags, resulting in a cleaner and more intuitive suggestion list.

[Issue #272352](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/272352)



## Authentication


## Languages


## Remote Development

The [Remote Development extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack), allow you to use a [Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers), remote machine via SSH or [Remote Tunnels](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/tunnels), or the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl) (WSL) as a full-featured development environment.

Highlights include:

* TODO: @ntrogh

You can learn more about these features in the [Remote Development release notes](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/blob/main/remote-release-notes/v1_107.md).
