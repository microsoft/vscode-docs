## Agents

## Chat

### Embedded terminal display

Chat terminal commands now embed an interactive xterm.js instance instead of plain text content, providing a richer terminal experience within chat responses.

[#276946](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/276946) - Embed xterm.js instead of text content

### Auto-approve URLs from chat messages

URLs that you explicitly include in a chat message are now automatically approved for the fetch tool, eliminating unnecessary approval prompts for content you've intentionally referenced.

[#276955](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/276955) - Auto approve URLs that are mentioned explicitly by the user

### Keyboard shortcut for task approval

Task execution approval dialogs now support keyboard shortcuts for faster confirmation of terminal commands.

[#276833](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/276833) - No keyboard shortcut for "wait for task"?

### Sensitive file diff preview

When Copilot requests permission to edit sensitive files like `package.json`, you now see a visual diff preview of the proposed changes instead of raw JSON, making it easier to understand the impact before approving.

[#266574](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/266574) - Copilot: Sensitive Files Diff Preview

### Fine-grained URL approval

The fetch tool now offers fine-grained auto-approval options, allowing you to approve specific URLs or entire domains instead of only broad session/workspace/permanent scopes.

[#265850](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/265850) - Support fine-grained auto approval reasons for fetch

### Session-based command approval

You can now approve terminal commands for the current chat session only, providing a middle ground between one-time approval and permanently adding commands to your settings.

[#260819](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/260819) - Allow commands in session

### AI code actions without Copilot extension

AI-related code actions like **Generate Documentation** are now available in the Quick Fix menu even when the Copilot extension is not installed, providing easier access to AI features.

[#260136](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/260136) - Show AI related code actions out of the box (menu, hover, quick fix)

## MCP

### User-Agent header for MCP servers

MCP client requests now include a proper User-Agent header identifying VS Code and its version, enabling server-side analytics and compatibility detection.

[#264502](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/264502) - Add proper User-Agent header for MCP server requests

### HTTPS resource support

MCP servers can now return resources with `https://` URLs, allowing VS Code to fetch web-based resources without bloating the context with inline blob data.

[#259253](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/259253) - Support for MCP resources with `https://` scheme

### GitHub MCP Server

The GitHub Copilot Chat extension now contributes the GitHub MCP Server, providing GitHub-related tools and resources without having to configure it explicitly.

[#254836](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/254836) - Contribute GitHub MCP Server from GitHub built in extension


## Accessibility


## Editor Experience

### Remove commands from recently used list

The Command Palette now includes an "X" button on recently used commands, allowing you to remove individual items from the recently used list without clearing your entire command history.

[#277311](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/277311) - Add "X" button to remove command from "recently used" list in Command Palette

### Default formatter selection improved

The default formatter dropdown in Settings now intelligently filters and sorts extensions, showing only those that contribute formatters at the top of the list instead of displaying all installed extensions.

[#277783](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/277783) - Settings: default formatter lists all extensions

### Inactive line highlight background color

You can now customize the background color of the current line in inactive editor groups using the new `editor.inactiveLineHighlightBackground` theme color. This improves visual clarity when working with multiple editor groups.

[#277272](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/277272) - Feature Request: Add editor.inactiveLineHighlightBackground Setting to VS Code

### Recently opened indicator

The recently opened picker now indicates which folders and workspaces are currently open in other windows, making it easier to avoid opening duplicate instances.

[#276460](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/276460) - Indicate if a recently opened folder/workspace is opened in another window

[#268277](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/268277) - In 'open recent windows', highlight windows that are currently open

### Move editor to new group

Select **Move Editor into Previous Group** from the left-most editor group to create a new group on the left and move the active editor into it. This mirrors the existing behavior when moving editors to the right.

[#262817](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/262817) - Running "Move Editor into Previous Group" from the left-most group should create a new group to the left.

### Close other windows action

You can now close all VS Code windows except the current one using the new **Close Other Windows** command.

[#233635](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/233635) - Add an action to close other windows

### Swipe to navigate on macOS

Trackpad swipe gestures for navigating forward and backward through editor history are now supported on macOS, controlled by the `workbench.editor.swipeToNavigate` setting.

[#204812](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/204812) - Re-instate swipeToNavigate for Mac

### Settings editor wildcard search

The Settings editor now supports wildcard patterns when searching by setting ID. Use `@id:settingPrefix.*` to find all settings matching a prefix.

[#242231](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/242231) - Support wildcards in Settings editor ID search

### Hover on demand

You can now disable automatic hover while keeping Ctrl+Hover functionality enabled using the `editor.hover.enabled` setting. This reduces interruptions while still allowing access to hover information when needed.

[#72025](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/72025) - Disable hover but keep Ctrl+Hover



## Code Editing


## Notebooks


## Source Control

### Draft comment icons in gutter

The editor gutter now displays a draft comment icon when a comment thread contains draft comments, providing better visibility of pending review feedback.

[#179162](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/179162) - Show draft comment icon in gutter when appropriate


## Debugging


## Tasks


## Terminal

### Git Bash icon

The Git Bash terminal profile on Windows now displays the Git Bash icon for easier identification.

[#275568](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/275568) - Add git bash icon to git bash terminal profile


## Authentication

### MSAL Broker support for Linux x64 and Intel Macs

Microsoft Authentication now supports the MSAL broker on Linux x64 and Intel Macs for enrolled machines that opt in to broker authentication.

- [#278688](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/278688) - Support Linux x64 for msal broker
- [#278687](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/278687) - Support MSAL Broker in Intel Macs


## Languages


## Remote Development

### GitHub Enterprise policies in Codespaces

Codespaces now respects GitHub Enterprise policies, ensuring compliance with organizational security and governance requirements.

[#278127](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/278127) - Support github enterprise policies in codespaces


## Contributions to extensions


## Extension Authoring

### Private extension marketplace
