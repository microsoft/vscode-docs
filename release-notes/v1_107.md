## Agents


## Chat

### Inline chat UI overhaul

We have continued the modernization of inline chat: it is now for making code changes only. There still is the `setting(inlineChat.enableV2:true)`-setting. Before it used to control the UI and extension logic. Now, it only changes how the extension handles your prompt. This is still under development but can tried with confidence.

<video src="images/1_107/inline_chat_edit.mp4" title="Showing Inline chat in action" autoplay loop controls muted></video>

For tasks Inline chat cannot handle, you'll be automatically upgraded to the Chat view where your prompt is being replayed, using the same model and the same context

<video src="images/1_107/inline_chat_exit.mp4" title="Showing Inline chat exit to Chat view flow" autoplay loop controls muted></video>

### Language Models editor

The **Language Models** editor is now available for all users, providing a centralized place to view and manage all available language models for GitHub Copilot Chat. You can open it from the chat model picker or via the command **Chat: Manage Language Models**.

<video src="images/1_107/language-models-editor.mp4" title="Video showing the Language Models editor" autoplay loop controls muted></video>

The editor displays:

* All available models organized by provider
* Model capabilities (tools, vision, agent)
* Context size and multiplier information
* Model visibility status

You can search and filter models using:

* Text search with highlighting
* Provider filter: `@provider:"OpenAI"`
* Capability filters: `@capability:tools`, `@capability:vision`, `@capability:agent`
* Visibility filter: `@visible:true/false`

You can group models by provider or visibility, making it easier to organize and navigate through your available models. Hover over model names or context sizes to see detailed information including model ID, version, status, and token breakdown.

#### Manage model visibility

Control which models appear in the chat model picker by toggling their visibility with the eye icon next to each model. When a model is visible, it appears in the model picker dropdown when you're using GitHub Copilot Chat, making it available for selection. Hidden models remain in the Language Models editor but won't appear in the model picker, helping you keep your model selection focused on the ones you use most frequently.

This is particularly useful when you have access to many models and want to streamline your workflow by showing only your preferred models in the picker.

#### Add models from installed providers

Use the **Add Models...** button to configure and add models from language model providers you've already installed. When you select this button, you'll see a dropdown list of all installed model providers, such as Copilot, Anthropic, Azure, Google, Groq, Ollama, OpenAI, and others. Select a provider from the list to configure it and start using its models in GitHub Copilot Chat.

This makes it easy to activate additional model providers you've installed without needing to navigate away from the Language Models editor. Access provider management by selecting the gear icon on provider rows.

### Improved URL and domain-based auto-approval for the fetch tool

This iteration, we've enhanced the security and user experience of auto-approving URLs for the fetch tool. When the model decides to fetch content from a URL that you did not explicitly ask for, you'll see the new approval experience. This comes in two parts: approval to make the request and approval to add the fetched content into the chat. These may seem like the same thing, but let's look at a simple example using GitHub.com:

```
https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/265850
```

You can probably trust that making a web request to a GitHub.com url is safe... it's a well-known and reputable site. However, it contains user-generated content that could potentially be harmful to an LLM via prompt injection. Because of this distinction, we've added a new approval experience that splits the fetch tool's behavior into two stages: making the request and adding the fetched content into the chat.

Let's break down these two stages.

#### Approval to make the request

![A confirmation is shown to approve the initial fetch request](images/1_107/approve-fetch.png)

This first approval dialog now offers options to:

* `Allow and Review` - a one-time approval for the specific URL with "response reviewing"
* `Allow and Skip Reviewing Result` - a one-time approval for the specific URL without "response reviewing"
* Always approve the request to this specific URL
* Always approve requests to all URLs from the domain
* `Allow requests to...` - shows you a picker that gives you a bird's-eye view of the domains you've trusted.

It's important to note that the "always approve" options here do not influence the "response reviewing" behavior, they only control whether you are prompted to approve the initial request.

**Note:** This approval also respects the "Trusted Domains" feature which you can manage via the `Manage Trusted Domains` command. If a domain is listed there, you are automatically approved to make requests to that domain and defer the "response reviewing" step.

With that said, let's look at the second part of the fetch tool's behavior.

#### Approval to add the fetched content into the chat

When the fetch tool retrieves content from a URL, it will now ask for your approval before adding the content into the chat:

![A confirmation is shown to approve adding the fetched content into the chat](images/1_107/approve-content.png)

This gives you the ability to review the fetched content before it is added to the chat, ensuring that you are not inadvertently adding potentially harmful or irrelevant information into your conversation.

It also provides different options to:

* `Allow` - a one-time approval for the content to be added to the chat
* Always allow responses from this specific URL
* Always allow responses from this domain
* `Allow requests to...` - shows you a picker that gives you a bird's-eye view of the domains you've trusted.

**Note:** An important distinction here is that this second approval is not tied to the "Trusted Domains" feature. In other words, domains listed there do not automatically grant approval to add the fetched content into the chat. This is a security measure to prevent potential issues with untrusted content on a domain that you would otherwise trust to make web requests to.

Lastly, if you'd prefer to manage the approvals via a setting, you can do so via the `setting(chat.tools.urls.autoApprove)` setting. This setting supports also supports globs and wildcards, so you can get very granular with the URLs that should be auto-approved.

We think this new auto-approval experience is a significant improvement in terms of security and user experience giving users more control over what content is fetched and added to the chat. Please don't hesitate to let us know what you think!

### Rich terminal output in chat

Using **Toggle Output** on a **Run in Terminal** response now renders output in a full, read-only `xterm.js` terminal inside chat. VS Code preserves captured output even after the backing terminal has exited, so you can reopen previous runs at any time.

The chat terminal now adopts the integrated terminal’s color theme for improved ANSI color contrast. Screen reader users can open the accessible view `(kb(editor.action.accessibleView))` when the output has focus, enabling easy review and navigation.

### Keyboard shortcuts for chat terminal actions

You can now focus the most recent chat terminal `(kb(workbench.action.terminal.chat.focusMostRecentChatTerminal))` or toggle its expansion state `(kb(workbench.action.terminal.chat.focusMostRecentChatTerminalOutput))` via dedicated keyboard shortcuts.

### Keyboard shortcuts for custom agents actions

Each custom agent now has a separate action in the command list for them and you can bind keyboard shortcuts to them individually.

### Command status details in chat terminals

Chat terminal messages now display command start time, duration, and exit code. Hover over the command decoration to check if a task is still running before deciding next steps.

![npm install candy is run by the agent and the command decoration hover displays command executed 2 mins ago, took 9.705s and failed (Exit code 1)](images/1_107/terminal-command-exit.png)


### Azure model provider: Entra ID as the default authentication
The Azure model provider now uses Entra ID authentication by default when connecting to Bring-Your-Own-Key (BYOK) models, providing improved security and a more streamlined sign-in experience. If you prefer to authenticate using an API key, you can switch back via the new setting: `"github.copilot.chat.azureAuthType": "apiKey"`. This setting defaults to "entraId".

## MCP

### Preview: GitHub MCP Server provided by GitHub Copilot Chat

The GitHub remote MCP Server is now provided as a built-in MCP server in the GitHub Copilot Chat extension, providing seamless integration with GitHub repositories and services. This integration offers several benefits:

* Alignment with other Copilot agent harnesses like Copilot CLI and Copilot Cloud Agent that already use the GitHub MCP Server
* Reuse of existing GitHub authentication state, eliminating additional authentication prompts
* Transparent support for different GitHub MCP endpoints including GHE.com

To enable the GitHub MCP Server, set the `setting(github.copilot.chat.githubMcpServer.enabled)` setting to `true`. Once enabled, the server automatically appears in the tool picker in Agent mode, allowing you to ask questions about GitHub issues, pull requests, and other repository information without additional configuration.

The GitHub MCP Server supports customization through several settings:

* `setting(github.copilot.chat.githubMcpServer.toolsets)`: Configure which tools are available. By default, the `default` toolset is used, but you can extend it by adding `workflows` or other toolsets as documented in the [GitHub MCP Server documentation](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server/blob/main/docs/remote-server.md#remote-mcp-toolsets). **Note:** Adding certain toolsets may require additional permissions and re-authentication is not yet supported. Please see [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/280640) to track progress.
* `setting(github.copilot.chat.githubMcpServer.readonly)`: Force the server to return only read-only tools, preventing any write operations.
* `setting(github.copilot.chat.githubMcpServer.lockdown)`: Additional security control for tool behavior.

**Note:** This feature is currently in Preview and requires explicit opt-in through the setting mentioned above. However, we are planning to enable it by default in a future release in a way that makes it available when wanted, but not intrusive when not needed.

## Accessibility

### Keyboard approval for chat confirmations

When an agent prompts for confirmation, you can now approve via keyboard using `(kb(workbench.action.chat.acceptTool))`.



## Editor Experience


## Code Editing


## Notebooks


## Source Control


## Debugging


## Tasks


## Terminal

### Terminal suggest rolling out to stable

Terminal Suggest is now available to stable users, offering inline completions and contextual hints while you type shell commands. Suggestions now group related argument values together, so option flags and their parameters stay organized in the list.


## Authentication

### More native broker support for Microsoft Authentication: Intel Macs & Linux x64

**Setting**: `setting(microsoft-authentication.implementation)`

This milestone, we adopted the latest MSAL libraries and with that you are now able to sign in through a native experience on:
* Intel Macs
* Linux x64 (just certain distros that are Debian-based)

![Screenshot of a native broker dialog window asking to sign into VS Code.](images/1_107/macOS-auth-broker.png)

This is in addition to the existing support for:
* Windows x64
* macOS M-series (ARM)

Note: macOS & Linux support requires your machine to be Intune enrolled & be opted in to using the native broker.

This enables nice single sign-on flows and is the recommended way of acquiring a Microsoft authentication session. The MSAL team will enable this up for the remaining platforms (Windows ARM, Linux ARM and additional distros) over time, so stay tuned!

> NOTE: If you have trouble authenticating via the broker, you can change the `setting(microsoft-authentication.implementation)` to `msal-no-broker`, which will use your browser to authenticate instead.

### `classic` Microsoft authentication no longer available. Use `msal-no-broker` if you experience issues

As mentioned last month, we have removed the `classic` option for `setting(microsoft-authentication.implementation)` due to low usage and it not being recommended by the Entra ID team.

Reminder: The `setting(microsoft-authentication.implementation)` setting has been around to let users opt-out of native brokered authentication for Microsoft accounts if they experienced issues. The values for this setting are:

* `msal` - Use MSAL with brokered authentication when available (default)
* `msal-no-broker` - Use MSAL without brokered authentication

## Languages

### TypeScript 7.0 preview

We continued to work with the TypeScript team to improve VS Code's support for the [upcoming TypeScript 7 release](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/progress-on-typescript-7-december-2025/). TypeScript 7 is a complete rewrite in native code and will offer dramatically better performance.

The TypeScript 7 preview has almost complete type checking support, and the TypeScript team has been busy adding editor features too. Recent highlights include auto import completions, rename support, and references code lenses.

You can try out TypeScript 7.0 today by installing the [`TypeScript (Native Preview` extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TypeScriptTeam.native-preview). Then run the `TypeScript (Native Preview): Enable (Experimental)` command in a JavaScript or TypeScript file to switch all IntelliSense to use the native preview.

We plan to continue working closely with the TypeScript team to improve TypeScript 7's VS Code support. Once TypeScript 7 is ready, our longer term plan is to switch to it as the default experience powering VS Code's JavaScript and TypeScript IntelliSense. Don't though if you need to use an older TS version or need editor features like TypeScript service plugins that can't be easily ported ot TypeScript 7, we're planning to continue supporting existing TypeScript versions for the foreseeable future alongside TypeScript 7.0+.

## Remote Development

The [Remote Development extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack), allow you to use a [Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers), remote machine via SSH or [Remote Tunnels](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/tunnels), or the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl) (WSL) as a full-featured development environment.

Highlights include:

* TODO: @ntrogh

You can learn more about these features in the [Remote Development release notes](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/blob/main/remote-release-notes/v1_107.md).

### Updated build scripts run directly as TypeScript

This iteration we cleaned up our build scripts to make them easier to work with and maintain. These build scripts were a mix of compiled TypeScript, TypeScript files run using `ts-node`, and JavaScript. Many of these scripts were not type checked and were using commonjs (`require`) instead of modern modules with `import` and `export`. Ever worse, many of the TypeScript build scripts required checking in the compiled JS output to our source control. What a mess!

Thankfully Node 22.18+ now allows [run scripts directly as TypeScript](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/typescript/run-natively). This let us incrementally convert our build scripts to modern TypeScript. We used the follow tsconfig options to make sure our new TypeScript code could be run directly by node:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
     "target": "esnext",
     "module": "nodenext",
     "noEmit": true, // Don't generate .js files
     "erasableSyntaxOnly": true, // Only allow TypeScript syntax that node can strip out. Enums and namespaces for example are not allowed
     "allowImportingTsExtensions": true, // Allow importing of .ts files
     "verbatimModuleSyntax": true // Make sure imports will be valid when the script is run by node directly
  }
}
```

Copilot helped automate many of the required changes, such as converting old commonjs files to modules and adding type annotations.

One thing to keep in mind is that while node can run TypeScript code, it doesn't actually type check it. You still need to use `tsc` for that. For vscode, we're actuall using [`ts-go`](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/progress-on-typescript-7-december-2025/) which can fully type check all of our build scripts in well under a second.

It's pretty amazing to be able to run `node build/hygiene.ts` directly. Switching fully to TypeScript also let us modernize and bring type safety to our build scripts, which will make is mch easier to understand and make changes to them. Plus it let us delete around 15,000 lines of compiled JS code that we previously had to keep checked in!
