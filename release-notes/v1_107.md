## Agents


## Chat

### Inline chat UI overhaul

We have continued the modernization of inline chat: it is now for making code changes only. There still is the `setting(inlineChat.enableV2:true)`-setting. Before it used to control the UI and extension logic. Now, it only changes how the extension handles your prompt. This is still under development but can tried with confidence.

For tasks Inline chat cannot handle, you'll be automatically upgraded to the Chat view where your prompt is being replayed, using the same model and the same context

### Language Models editor

The **Language Models** editor is now available for all users, providing a centralized place to view and manage all available language models for GitHub Copilot Chat. You can open it from the chat model picker or via the command **Chat: Manage Language Models**.

<video src="images/1_107/language-models-editor.mp4" title="Video showing the Language Models editor" autoplay loop controls muted></video>

The editor displays:

* All available models organized by provider
* Model capabilities (tools, vision, agent)
* Context size and multiplier information
* Model visibility status

You can search and filter models using:

* Text search with highlighting
* Provider filter: `@provider:"OpenAI"`
* Capability filters: `@capability:tools`, `@capability:vision`, `@capability:agent`
* Visibility filter: `@visible:true/false`

You can group models by provider or visibility, making it easier to organize and navigate through your available models. Hover over model names or context sizes to see detailed information including model ID, version, status, and token breakdown.

#### Manage model visibility

Control which models appear in the chat model picker by toggling their visibility with the eye icon next to each model. When a model is visible, it appears in the model picker dropdown when you're using GitHub Copilot Chat, making it available for selection. Hidden models remain in the Language Models editor but won't appear in the model picker, helping you keep your model selection focused on the ones you use most frequently.

This is particularly useful when you have access to many models and want to streamline your workflow by showing only your preferred models in the picker.

#### Add models from installed providers

Use the **Add Models...** button to configure and add models from language model providers you've already installed. When you select this button, you'll see a dropdown list of all installed model providers, such as Copilot, Anthropic, Azure, Google, Groq, Ollama, OpenAI, and others. Select a provider from the list to configure it and start using its models in GitHub Copilot Chat.

This makes it easy to activate additional model providers you've installed without needing to navigate away from the Language Models editor. Access provider management by selecting the gear icon on provider rows.

### Rich terminal output in chat

Using **Toggle Output** on a **Run in Terminal** response now renders output in a full, read-only `xterm.js` terminal inside chat. VS Code preserves captured output even after the backing terminal has exited, so you can reopen previous runs at any time.

The chat terminal now adopts the integrated terminal’s color theme for improved ANSI color contrast. Screen reader users can open the accessible view `(kb(editor.action.accessibleView))` when the output has focus, enabling easy review and navigation.

### Keyboard shortcuts for chat terminal actions

You can now focus the most recent chat terminal `(kb(workbench.action.terminal.chat.focusMostRecentChatTerminal))` or toggle its expansion state `(kb(workbench.action.terminal.chat.focusMostRecentChatTerminalOutput))` via dedicated keyboard shortcuts.

### Command status details in chat terminals

Chat terminal messages now display command start time, duration, and exit code. Hover over the command decoration to check if a task is still running before deciding next steps.

![npm install candy is run by the agent and the command decoration hover displays command executed 2 mins ago, took 9.705s and failed (Exit code 1)](images/1_107/terminal-command-exit.png)

## Accessibility

### Keyboard approval for chat confirmations

When an agent prompts for confirmation, you can now approve via keyboard using `(kb(workbench.action.chat.acceptTool))`.

## Terminal

### Terminal suggest rolling out to stable

Terminal Suggest is now available to stable users, offering inline completions and contextual hints while you type shell commands. Suggestions now group related argument values together, so option flags and their parameters stay organized in the list.


## Authentication


## Languages


## Remote Development

The [Remote Development extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack), allow you to use a [Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers), remote machine via SSH or [Remote Tunnels](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/tunnels), or the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl) (WSL) as a full-featured development environment.

Highlights include:
