## Agents


## Chat

### Inline chat UI overhaul

We have continued the modernization of inline chat: it is now for making code changes only. There still is the `setting(inlineChat.enableV2:true)`-setting. Before it used to control the UI and extension logic. Now, it only changes how the extension handles your prompt. This is still under development but can tried with confidence.

<video src="images/1_107/inline_chat_edit.mp4" title="Showing Inline chat in action" autoplay loop controls muted></video>

For tasks Inline chat cannot handle, you'll be automatically upgraded to the Chat view where your prompt is being replayed, using the same model and the same context

<video src="images/1_107/inline_chat_exit.mp4" title="Showing Inline chat exit to Chat view flow" autoplay loop controls muted></video>

### Language Models editor

The **Language Models** editor is now available for all users, providing a centralized place to view and manage all available language models for GitHub Copilot Chat. You can open it from the chat model picker or via the command **Chat: Manage Language Models**.

<video src="images/1_107/language-models-editor.mp4" title="Video showing the Language Models editor" autoplay loop controls muted></video>

The editor displays:

* All available models organized by provider
* Model capabilities (tools, vision, agent)
* Context size and multiplier information
* Model visibility status

You can search and filter models using:

* Text search with highlighting
* Provider filter: `@provider:"OpenAI"`
* Capability filters: `@capability:tools`, `@capability:vision`, `@capability:agent`
* Visibility filter: `@visible:true/false`

You can group models by provider or visibility, making it easier to organize and navigate through your available models. Hover over model names or context sizes to see detailed information including model ID, version, status, and token breakdown.

#### Manage model visibility

Control which models appear in the chat model picker by toggling their visibility with the eye icon next to each model. When a model is visible, it appears in the model picker dropdown when you're using GitHub Copilot Chat, making it available for selection. Hidden models remain in the Language Models editor but won't appear in the model picker, helping you keep your model selection focused on the ones you use most frequently.

This is particularly useful when you have access to many models and want to streamline your workflow by showing only your preferred models in the picker.

#### Add models from installed providers

Use the **Add Models...** button to configure and add models from language model providers you've already installed. When you select this button, you'll see a dropdown list of all installed model providers, such as Copilot, Anthropic, Azure, Google, Groq, Ollama, OpenAI, and others. Select a provider from the list to configure it and start using its models in GitHub Copilot Chat.

This makes it easy to activate additional model providers you've installed without needing to navigate away from the Language Models editor. Access provider management by selecting the gear icon on provider rows.

### Rich terminal output in chat

Using **Toggle Output** on a **Run in Terminal** response now renders output in a full, read-only `xterm.js` terminal inside chat. VS Code preserves captured output even after the backing terminal has exited, so you can reopen previous runs at any time.

The chat terminal now adopts the integrated terminal’s color theme for improved ANSI color contrast. Screen reader users can open the accessible view `(kb(editor.action.accessibleView))` when the output has focus, enabling easy review and navigation.

### Keyboard shortcuts for chat terminal actions

You can now focus the most recent chat terminal `(kb(workbench.action.terminal.chat.focusMostRecentChatTerminal))` or toggle its expansion state `(kb(workbench.action.terminal.chat.focusMostRecentChatTerminalOutput))` via dedicated keyboard shortcuts.

### Keyboard shortcuts for custom agents actions

Each custom agent now has a separate action in the command list for them and you can bind keyboard shortcuts to them individually.

### Command status details in chat terminals

Chat terminal messages now display command start time, duration, and exit code. Hover over the command decoration to check if a task is still running before deciding next steps.

![npm install candy is run by the agent and the command decoration hover displays command executed 2 mins ago, took 9.705s and failed (Exit code 1)](images/1_107/terminal-command-exit.png)

## MCP

### Preview: GitHub MCP Server provided by GitHub Copilot Chat

The GitHub remote MCP Server is now provided as a built-in MCP server in the GitHub Copilot Chat extension, providing seamless integration with GitHub repositories and services. This integration offers several benefits:

* Alignment with other Copilot agent harnesses like Copilot CLI and Copilot Cloud Agent that already use the GitHub MCP Server
* Reuse of existing GitHub authentication state, eliminating additional authentication prompts
* Transparent support for different GitHub MCP endpoints including GHE.com

To enable the GitHub MCP Server, set the `setting(github.copilot.chat.githubMcpServer.enabled)` setting to `true`. Once enabled, the server automatically appears in the tool picker in Agent mode, allowing you to ask questions about GitHub issues, pull requests, and other repository information without additional configuration.

The GitHub MCP Server supports customization through several settings:

* `setting(github.copilot.chat.githubMcpServer.toolsets)`: Configure which tools are available. By default, the `default` toolset is used, but you can extend it by adding `workflows` or other toolsets as documented in the [GitHub MCP Server documentation](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server/blob/main/docs/remote-server.md#remote-mcp-toolsets). **Note:** Adding certain toolsets may require additional permissions and re-authentication is not yet supported. Please see [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/280640) to track progress.
* `setting(github.copilot.chat.githubMcpServer.readonly)`: Force the server to return only read-only tools, preventing any write operations.
* `setting(github.copilot.chat.githubMcpServer.lockdown)`: Additional security control for tool behavior.

**Note:** This feature is currently in Preview and requires explicit opt-in through the setting mentioned above. However, we are planning to enable it by default in a future release in a way that makes it available when wanted, but not intrusive when not needed.

## Accessibility

### Keyboard approval for chat confirmations

When an agent prompts for confirmation, you can now approve via keyboard using `(kb(workbench.action.chat.acceptTool))`.



## Editor Experience


## Code Editing


## Notebooks


## Source Control


## Debugging


## Tasks


## Terminal

### Terminal suggest rolling out to stable

Terminal Suggest is now available to stable users, offering inline completions and contextual hints while you type shell commands. Suggestions now group related argument values together, so option flags and their parameters stay organized in the list.


## Authentication

### More native broker support for Microsoft Authentication: Intel Macs & Linux x64

**Setting**: `setting(microsoft-authentication.implementation)`

This milestone, we adopted the latest MSAL libraries and with that you are now able to sign in through a native experience on:
* Intel Macs
* Linux x64 (just certain distros that are Debian-based)

![Screenshot of a native broker dialog window asking to sign into VS Code.](images/1_107/macOS-auth-broker.png)

This is in addition to the existing support for:
* Windows x64
* macOS M-series (ARM)

Note: macOS & Linux support requires your machine to be Intune enrolled & be opted in to using the native broker.

This enables nice single sign-on flows and is the recommended way of acquiring a Microsoft authentication session. The MSAL team will enable this up for the remaining platforms (Windows ARM, Linux ARM and additional distros) over time, so stay tuned!

> NOTE: If you have trouble authenticating via the broker, you can change the `setting(microsoft-authentication.implementation)` to `msal-no-broker`, which will use your browser to authenticate instead.

## Languages


## Remote Development

The [Remote Development extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack), allow you to use a [Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers), remote machine via SSH or [Remote Tunnels](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/tunnels), or the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl) (WSL) as a full-featured development environment.

Highlights include:

* TODO: @ntrogh
