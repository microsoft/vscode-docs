## Insiders Release

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the November 1.41 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll see details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the November milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[November iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/83930)** - See what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22November+2019%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people taking a look at our new features as soon as they are ready so check back here often and learn what's new to try out.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the [VS Code repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues) on GitHub.

## Workbench

### Compact folders in Explorer

In the File Explorer, we now render single child folders in a compact form. In such a form, single child folders will be compressed in a combined tree element. Useful for Java package structures, for example.

Setting `explorer.compactFolders` controls this behavior. By default, this setting is turned on.

![Explorer compact](images/1_41/explorer-compact.gif)

### Improved font rendering (Windows, Linux)

When we updated to Electron 6 last milestone, many users reported that font rendering regressed for them. Specifically, fonts did not render as smoothly as they used to. We immediately [addressed the issue](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/84214) in the editor and the fix was made available in a 1.40 recovery release. However, other areas in the workbench still suffered from less than ideal font rendering.

In this release, we improved font rendering in more parts of the workbench (Windows and Linux). The screenshots below show a before and after comparison (zoomed in to show the difference). In particular, many tree and list elements of the workbench were rendered using greyscale antialiasing and they now render with subpixel antialiasing.

Before (left) and after (right):

![LCD before and after](images/1_41/lcd.png)

We plan to improve font rendering in even more parts of the workbench. You can check out this [query](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/labels/lcd-text-rendering) for progress on that topic.

### Edit left-hand side in diffs

If you compare two editors that are editable (for example, from the File Explorer by comparing two files or running a global Search & Replace), the left-hand side is now also editable and can be saved (`kb(workbench.action.files.save)`).

![Left-hand diff edit](images/1_41/save-diff.gif)

**Note:** You can enable Auto Save (**File** > **Auto Save**) if you are tired of pressing `kb(workbench.action.files.save)`.

### Save from peek editors

If you bring up a peek view and type into it, you can now save it via `kb(workbench.action.files.save)`, if the focus is inside that embedded editor.

![Peek save](images/1_41/save-peek.gif)

### Faster read/write file performance for remote scenarios

Reading and writing files (from the text editor) should now be faster for scenarios where the file system is remote and the latency is high (for example when using VS Code in a browser with a slow connection or being connected to a remote host that is not in the same region). We switched to a stream-based implementation for reads and writes that greatly reduces communication overhead.

### Problems panel

**More Filters**

More predefined filters are added to the Problems panel. You can now filter problems by type and also see problems scoped to the current active file.

![Problems Filters](images/1_41/problems-filters.gif)

Theme: GitHub Sharp Dark, Font: FiraCode

**Show current problem in Status bar**

You can now configure VS Code to show the current problem message in the Status bar. This will allow you to see the summary of the problem that is selected in the opened file without any additional keyboard or mouse gestures.

**Note:** Enabling this feature needs enabling the setting `problems.showCurrentInStatus`.

![Problems Filters](images/1_41/problems-show-current.gif)

Theme: GitHub Sharp Dark, Font: FiraCode

**Flexible filter box layout**

Filter box in the Problems panel adjusts its position nicely according to the panel's position and size.

![Problems Filters](images/1_41/problems-flexible-filter.gif)

Theme: GitHub Sharp Dark, Font: FiraCode

### Search
**Add cursors to search results**

We've added a command to add a cursor to all matches of a text search. With focus on a file's search results in the search viewlet, you can press `kbstyle(Ctrl+Shift+L)`/`kbstyle(Cmd+Shift+L)` to edit all matches in that one file simultanously. This matches the same keyboard shortcut that we already have to do the same thing when searching inside a single editor with the find widget.

![Add cursors to search results](images/1_41/add-cursors-to-search-results.gif)

**Expand all search results by default**

Previously, if a full text search returned more than 10 results in a single file, it would appear collaped in the results tree. However, this sometimes made finding a particular result difficult, so with this release all results will appear expanded.

You can set `search.collapseResults` to `auto` to revert to the old behaviour.

**Update search results as you type**

In full text search, results will now update as you type. This is especially helpful in scenarios like constructing complicated Regular Expression queries, where fast feedback about what a query means can help you work how to write the RegEx.

Here, the instant feedback helps in constructing a RegEx find & replace query for adopting TypeScript's optional chaining syntax:

![Search on Type](images/1_41/search-on-type.gif)
Theme: Noctis Hibernus, Font: Hasklig

**Note:** This can be disabled by disabling the setting `search.searchOnType`, and the delay between typing and searching can be adjusted with the setting `search.searchOnTypeDebouncePeriod`.

**Preview: Search Editor**

In this milestone, we've started work on showing the results of a search in an editor. This provides much more space to view search results and allows users to maintain multiple collections of search results simultaneously. With this release, in a search editor you can:

- Navigate to results using **Go to Definition**-family commands, including **Peek Definition** and **Open Definition to Side**.
- Rerun a search to update the list of results
- View lines of context surrounding a result
- Persist results to disk to be referenced later or even tracked in SCM

We will be continuing to add functionality and increase usability in the coming releases.

![Search Editor](images/1_41/search-editor.gif)
Theme: A Touch of Lilac, Font: Hasklig

**Note:** You can preview this feature by enabling the setting `search.enableSearchEditorPreview`.

## Editor

### Code navigation alternate commands

VS Code used to do nothing when selecting **Go to Definition** while already at the definition. With this release, alternate commands can be executed instead. For instance, **Go to Definition** can be mapped to run **Go to References**.

This is customized via the `editor.gotoLocation.alternativeDefinitionCommand` setting. For example, you can make the alternate for **Go to Definition** be **Go to Declaration** and vice versa. You can leave the setting empty if you prefer the old behavior.

### Peek, Go to, and Find All commands

Each **Peek** command now has a **Go to** counterpart. For instance, there are now both **Peek Implementations** and **Go to Implementations**. The Peek view doesn't change the current editor and allows for a quick in-place look at source code.

The video below shows all implementations of the `ICommandService` interface:

![Peek Implementations](images/1_41/peek-impl.gif)

Theme: GitHub Sharp, Font: FiraCode

In contrast, **Go to Implementations** is about navigation and gets you to an implementation quickly.

The video below (using the `"editor.gotoLocation.multipleImplementations": "goto"` setting) navigates to all implementations of the `ICommandService` interface by repeatedly pressing `kbstyle(12)`:

![Go to Implementations](images/1_41/goto-impl.gif)

Theme: GitHub Sharp, Font: FiraCode

Last but not least, similar to the **Find All References** command, there is now **Find All Implementations**. It presents the implementations as a stable list to the side of the editor. This can be used as a TODO list, for example when performing a refactoring that affects all implementations of an interface.

![Find All Implementations](images/1_41/find-impl.gif)

Theme: GitHub Sharp, Font: FiraCode

### Call Hierarchy view

The call hierarchy API is generally available and while language servers are busy implementing it, we have added a Call Hierarchy view. This complements the Peek Call Hierarchy feature and shares the same view as **Find All References** and **Find All Implementations**. Select **Show Call Hierarchy** from the context menu or the Command Palette to see the view:

![Call Hierarchy Viewlet](images/1_41/callhierarchy-view.png)

Theme: GitHub Sharp, Font: FiraCode

The Call Hierarchy view allows you to drill into the callers from and calls of a symbol. It highlights calls in the active editor, allows reparenting the view from any children, and it keeps a history of previous runs.

### Language-specific filtering for breadcrumbs and Outline view

Last milestone, we have added the capability to filter certain types, like variables, from the Outline view and breadcrumbs navigation. This release refines this features and allows language-specific filtering, for example don't show TypeScript variables but do show JavaScript variables.

![Language-specific filter for Outline view](images/1_41/lang-filter.gif)

Theme: GitHub Sharp, Font: Fira Code

### IntelliSense keyboard shortcuts on macOS

IntelliSense is usually triggered via `kbstyle(Ctrl+Space)`. On macOS however, this keyboard shortcut is taken by the operating system when multiple input sources are configured. This often leads to confusion and users thinking IntelliSense is broken. There are two ways to handle this:

* Use the new `kbstyle(Option+Esc)` keyboard shortcut that we have added for macOS.
* Disable Input Source switching via `kbstyle(Ctrl+Space)` in your macOS preferences through **Preferences** > **Keyboard** > **Shortcuts** > **Input Sources**.

![macOS shortcuts](images/1_41/macos-shortcuts.png)

### Minimap decorations for errors, warnings, and content changes

Errors and warnings are now highlighted inline in the minimap (code overview). You can change the color of these decorations with the new `minimap.errorHighlight` and `minimap.warningHighlight` theme colors.

![Minimap error and warning decorations](images/1_41/minimap-errors-and-warnings.png)

Content changes decorations are also shown in the gutter of the minimap, and can be themed with the `minimapGutter.addedBackground`, `minimapGutter.modifiedBackground` and `minimapGutter.deletedBackground`.

![Minimap content change decorations](images/1_41/minimap-content-changes.png)

You can change the visibility of source control decorations with the `scm.diffDecorations` setting, which has the values:

* `none` - Show source control diff decorations in all locations.
* `gutter` - Only show in the editor gutter.
* `minimap` - Only show in the minimap gutter.
* `overview` - Only show in the overview ruler.
* `none` -  Do not show the diff decorations.

### editor.accessibilityPageSize

There is a new setting `editor.accessibilityPageSize` that controls the number of lines in the editor that can be read out by a screen reader at once. Note that this has performance implications for numbers larger than the default of 10.

For users that use the screen reader **Say All** command, we recommend setting `editor.accessibilityPageSize` to 100 or 1000. Next milestone, we will look into changing the default value of this setting.

## Integrated terminal

### New experimental WebGL renderer

A new WebGL-based renderer is available for the terminal, which boasts performance gains of up to 900%\* compared to the old canvas-based approach. You can opt in to use the new renderer with this setting:

```json
"terminal.integrated.rendererType": "experimentalWebgl"
```

The speed improvements are attributed to many things but here are the highlights:

* WebGL allows us to talk more directly to the GPU, as opposed to going via the web platform's `CanvasRenderingContext2D` API.
* The renderer deals almost exclusively with numbers and typed arrays, which are extremely fast. Object and array creation is also kept to a minimum to avoid unnecessary garbage collection.
* **All** characters are now cached in a texture atlas as opposed to just ASCII with a limited set of styles. This means repeated drawing of the same character is much faster.

We observed rendering of frames varying wildly based on a user's hardware/environment with the canvas renderer. Each frame would typically take anywhere from 1 ms to 40 ms but could reach to over 200 ms in extreme cases, where hardware issues were a factor. So far, WebGL seems much more consistent, typically sitting in the 0.2 ms to 2 ms range:

![WebGL frames are much faster](images/1_41/webgl1.png)

Reliability is one of the things we expect to improve once this is integrated. With the canvas renderer, the browser would try to be clever and fall back to rendering on the CPU if there were problems with the GPU/canvas, but we never want that to happen as we have a DOM-based renderer, which is much more suited for that. With WebGL, it should either work as expected or fail hard (a WebGL context cannot be acquired), in which case we can fall back to the DOM renderer.

Since rendering takes so much less time, the CPU is freed up to focus on parsing incoming data, which results in more frames rendered and commands that run faster. The following screenshot was generated from running `ls -lR` inside the vs code repository:

![Commands run faster on the WebGL renderer](images/1_41/webgl2.png)

The new renderer also fixes a nasty bug with the canvas renderer where characters would get their sides clipped when they are larger than the cell size. This issue was most commonly observed with certain fonts on Linux with underscores.

\* *More info on benchmarks available at [xtermjs/xterm.js#1790](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/1790)*

### Minimum contrast ratio

Applications working with colors in the terminal can be tricky, they can use the following colors for text:

* The default foreground color
* A palette of 16 colors as defined by the terminal theme
* A set of 240 fixed colors
* Any rgb color (16 million)

The problem is the application doesn't know what the default background color or foreground color is and whether it will have good contrast or not and sometimes they draw colors that users have issues with.

To solve this problem, the terminal can now change the foreground color of text dynamically to meet a certain contrast ratio. Set the color to the desired contrast ratio ranging from 1 to 21:

```json
// 4.5 is recommended for baseline website accessibility
"terminal.integrated.minimumContrastRatio": 4.5
```

Then the colors will increase or decrease luminance until either the contrast ratio is met or the foreground becomes `#000000` or `#ffffff`.

![Terminal contrast](images/1_41/terminal-contrast.gif)

## Languages

### HTML mirror cursor

VS Code now adds a "mirror cursor" when you are editing HTML tags. This behavior is controlled by the setting `html.mirrorCursorOnMatchingTag`.

This feature works by adding a [multi-cursor](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/codebasics#_multiple-selections-multicursor) to the matching tag when your cursor moves into a HTML tag name range. Just like in multi-cursor mode, you can use word-wise deletion or word-wise selection. The mirrored cursor is removed when you move your cursor outside the tag name range.

One special case is entering space when the cursor is at the end of the opening tag: `<div|></div|>`. In this case, VS Code removes the inserted space after the closing tag name and exits mirror cursor mode, so you can continue to edit HTML attributes.

![HTML mirror cursor](images/1_41/html-mirror-cursor.gif)

### HTML rename tags

You can now use F2 to rename the opening/closing tag pairs in HTML.

![HTML rename](images/1_41/html-rename.gif)

### Ranking of auto-completed CSS properties

CSS auto-completion now ranks properties by their popularity:

![css-ranking-by-popularity](images/1_41/css-ranking-by-popularity.png)

The usage data is sourced from [ChromeStatus.org](https://www.chromestatus.com/metrics/css/popularity).

### Sass Modules support

Sass recently introduced a [new module system](http://sass.logdown.com/posts/7858341-the-module-system-is-launched).

We have added syntax highlighting support, as well as language feature support for SASS Modules in **SCSS** files. The language features include:

- Auto completion of `@use` and `@forward`
- Path completion for `@use` and `@forward` path
- Auto completion of SASS [built-in modules](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/modules) such as `sass:math` and `sass:color`
- Document Link for `@use` and `@forward` import paths

![Sass Module support](images/1_41/sass-module-support.gif)

### JSON

To avoid performance issues with large files, JSON language support has an upper limit of folding regions and document symbols it computes (for the Outline view and breadcrumbs). By the default, the limit is 5000, but you can change the limit with the setting `json.maxItemsComputed`.

![JSON large file warning](images/1_41/json-large-file-warning.png)

### TypeScript 3.7

<!-- TODO mjbvz -->

### Optional chaining support for JavaScript and TypeScript

<!-- TODO mjbvz -->

### Extract interface refactoring for TypeScript

<!-- TODO mjbvz -->

### Semicolon formatter options for JavaScript and TypeScript

<!-- TODO mjbvz -->

### Uncalled function checks

<!-- TODO mjbvz -->

## Debugging

A new setting `debug.showInlineBreakpointCandidates` controls whether inline breakpoints candidate decorations should be shown in the editor while debugging. By default, they are visible.

### Debug START view

We have introduced a new debug START view to make it easier for users to start and configure debugging in a new workspace. Based on the active file, we will choose the appropriate debug extension and make it possible to debug or run your application. For more elaborate debug and run configurations, it is best to configure a `launch.json` file.

![debugStart](images/1_41/debug.gif)

### Restart frame as an inline action in the CALL STACK view

To improve the discoverability of the **Restart Frame** action, we have introduced it as an inline action in the CALL STACK view visible on hover. Restarting frames is a handy way to rerun the preceding code after a breakpoint is hit. If the debug extension does not support restarting frames, we will not show this action.

![Restart frame](images/1_41/restart-frame.png)

### Debug console: clearer indication of what is input and what is output

In order to distinguish input and output better in the Debug console, we have introduced opaque decorations to the left.

![Debug console decorations](images/1_41/repl-decorations.png)

## Contributions to extensions

### ESLint

Improvements to the [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) extension:

* Better support for ESLint 6.x - In most cases, it shouldn't be necessary to configure working directories when using ESLint 6.x.
* Improved TypeScript detection - As soon as TypeScript is correctly configured inside ESLint, you no longer need additional configuration through VS Code's `eslint.validate` setting. The same is true for HTML and VUE files.
* Glob working directory support - Projects that have a complex folder setup and need to customize the working directories via `eslint.workingDirectories` can now use glob patterns instead of listing every project folder. For example, `code-*` will match all project folders starting with `code-`. In addition, the extension now changes the working directory by default. You can disable this feature with the new `!cwd` property.
* Improved Auto Fix on Save - Auto Fix on Save is now part of VS Code's Code Action on save infrastructure and computes all possible fixes in one round. It is customized via the `editor.codeActionsOnSave` setting. The setting supports the ESLint specific property `source.fixAll.eslint`. The extension also respects the generic property `source.fixAll`.

For example:

```json
    "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
        "source.fixAll": true
    }
```

turns on Auto Fix for all providers including ESLint.

In contrast:

```json
    "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
        "source.fixAll.eslint": true
    }
```

only turns it on for ESLint.

You can also selectively disable ESLint via:

```json
    "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
        "source.fixAll": true,
        "source.fixAll.eslint": false
    }
```

### vscode-scss

[vscode-scss](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mrmlnc.vscode-scss) offers cross-file language support for SCSS variables, mixins, and functions. In this milestone, we helped its development for a new release, [0.8.0](https://github.com/mrmlnc/vscode-scss/releases/tag/v0.8.0). The new version improves import path resolution and performance. vscode-scss now shows color preview for color variables in auto-completion as well.

Improvements include:

* Better import path resolution
* Color preview for auto-completed color variable
* Better performance

## Extension authoring

### Figma Design Toolkit

We've created a design toolkit to better help extension authors design experiences for their extensions. [Checkout the toolkit repo on GitHub](https://aka.ms/vscode-figma-toolkit) that has  instructions on how to access and use the toolkit. Below is an example of some of the components included:

![image](images/1_41/figma-toolkit-1.gif)

All components should be resizable and editable. If you run into any issues or have any requests for certain components, please create an issue so that we can triage and track the requests.

![image](images/1_41/figma-toolkit-2.gif)

### Icon color tokens

We've added a set of new color tokens for the debug views.

### Debug toolbar
- `debugIcon.startForeground`
- `debugIcon.continueForeground`
- `debugIcon.disconnectForeground`
- `debugIcon.pauseForeground`
- `debugIcon.restartForeground`
- `debugIcon.stepBackForeground`
- `debugIcon.stepIntoForeground`
- `debugIcon.stepOutForeground`
- `debugIcon.stepOverForeground`
- `debugIcon.stopForeground`

![image](images/1_41/debug-color-tokens-1.png)
Theme: [Min Dark](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=miguelsolorio.min-theme), Font: [Input Mono](https://input.fontbureau.com/)

### Debug breakpoints
- `debugIcon.breakpointForeground`
- `debugIcon.breakpointDisabledForeground`
- `debugIcon.breakpointUnverifiedForeground`
- `debugIcon.breakpointStackframeForeground`
- `debugIcon.breakpointCurrentStackframeForeground`

![image](images/1_41/debug-color-tokens-2.png)

Theme: [Min Dark](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=miguelsolorio.min-theme), Font: [Input Mono](https://input.fontbureau.com/)


### Workspace file events

There are new events for when files and folders change:

* `vscode.workspace.on[Will|Did]CreateFile`
* `vscode.workspace.on[Will|Did]RenameFile`
* `vscode.workspace.on[Will|Did]DeleteFile`

The events are fired when files are created, renamed, or deleted from the Explorer or from extensions via the `vscode.workspace.applyEdit(WorkspaceEdit)` API but not when files change on disk or when files are modified via the `vscode.workspace.fs` API.

A possible use case for these events is a language server, which might update the contents of a file before renaming it or update project files after deletion/creation of files.

### SnippetString

The `SnippetString` type has now a builder-method for choice-elements.

### Strict getWordRangeAtPosition

The [`TextDocument.getWordRangeAtPosition`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/58479e80ab899402283b522da173c34867d7c78f/src/vs/vscode.d.ts#L224) API is now more strict and instead of ignoring invalid regular expressions that result in empty string matches, it will throw an error.

### Deprecated string type for extensionKind

Extension authors can use the `extensionKind` property in `package.json` to indicate where an extension should run in the remote case. In release (1.40), this value could be a string or an array. Starting with this release, this property only supports an array value and using a string is deprecated. See the [documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/advanced-topics/remote-extensions#incorrect-execution-location) for more information.

### Debug API: debug.asDebugSourceUri

The VS Code extension API uses document URIs when referring to resources that can be opened in editors, whereas the [Debug Adapter Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol/) is based on [Source](https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol/specification#Types_Source) descriptors. In this milestone, we've added an API for connecting the two worlds. The function `debug.asDebugSourceUri` creates a URI from a DAP Source object. This makes opening a DAP Source into a VS Code editor simple:

```ts
export async function openDAPSource(session: vscode.DebugSession, source: DebugProtocol.Source) {
  const uri = vscode.debug.asDebugSourceUri(source, session);
  vscode.window.showTextDocument(vscode.workspace.openTextDocument(uri));
}
```

## Proposed extension APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always, we are keen on your feedback. This is what you have to do to try out a proposed API:

* You must use Insiders because proposed APIs change frequently.
* You must have this line in the `package.json` file of your extension: `"enableProposedApi": true`.
* Copy the latest version of the [`vscode.proposed.d.ts`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/vscode.proposed.d.ts) file into your project's source location.

Note that you cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. There may be breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.

### CodeAction.disabled

<!-- TODO: mjbvz -->

### Custom Editors progress

<!-- TODO: mjbvz -->

## Language Server Protocol

Proposed support for the [call hierarchy](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-languageserver-node/blob/dbaeumer/moreIntegrationTests/protocol/src/protocol.callHierarchy.proposed.ts#L1) view via LSP.

## Browser support

### Improved support for Firefox and Safari (macOS & iPadOS)

During this milestone, we focused on improving the experience of VS Code running in a browser when using Firefox or Safari. We fixed many issues to support both browsers ([Firefox](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Afirefox+is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A%22November+2019%22), [Safari](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Asafari+is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A%22November+2019%22)). On Firefox, we don't have full keybinding support yet due to usptream blockers, you can read more details from the [tracking issue](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/85252).

We also fixed many [issues](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Asafari+label%3Aios+is%3Aclosed) to enable users to use basic functionalities of VS Code in Safari on iPadOS. Core UI elements are now accessible to touch and pointer devices. However we still have major blockers (read [this issue](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/85254) for more information), like predefined keybindings (Escape & Function keys), hovers and touch friendly UI/UX to be productive.

### More features available running in a browser

Last milestone, we [introduced support](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_40#_test-vs-code-running-in-a-browser) for running `yarn web` from our repository to set up VS Code running in the browser. This setup is still meant to be used for testing issues in browsers and not for development.

This milestone we added more features that can be tested:

* Debug
* Search
* Tasks
* Problems

Here is a video showing the new features in action:

![VS Code running in a browser](images/1_41/yarn-web.gif)

## Engineering

### Insiders available in the yum repository

The Insiders build is now available in the yum repository and is automatically published just like with the apt repository. Follow the [instructions on the website](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/linux#_rhel-fedora-and-centos-based-distributions) to set up the repo and install using `sudo dnf install code-insiders`.


### Continuous build for Monaco Editor

This iteration we added [continuous build and test pipeline](https://github.com/microsoft/monaco-editor/issues/1668) for Monaco Editor. We will build Monaco Editor core from master branch of VS Code repository and perform sanity testing against it to catch potential bugs or unexpected breaking changes as early as possible.
