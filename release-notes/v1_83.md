<!-- DOWNLOAD_LINKS_PLACEHOLDER -->

Welcome to the September 2023 release of Visual Studio Code. There are many updates in this version that we hope you'll like, some of the key highlights include:

TODO @gregvanl

## Accessibility

### GitHub Pull Requests and Issues Comment Improvements

The [GitHub Pull Requests and Issues](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github) extension, which allows you to work on, create, and manage pull requests and issues, has seen many accessibilty improvements this iteration for the commenting and reviewing experience.

A screen reader user is informed when they open an editor if it contains commenting ranges. A new accessibility help dialog (`editor.action.accessibilityHelp`) provides insight into commands that allow for navigation between comment threads and ranges.

Additionally, comment widgets have been made accessible. A help dialog (`editor.action.accessibilityHelp`) is also available in that context to inform a user of what to expect and how to utilize the feature.

## Editor

### Activate Nearest Quick Fix using the Quick Fix Hotekey

There is a new setting that allows you to activate the nearest Quick Fix in a line from `Ctrl + . ` or from the hotkey (`editor.action.quickFix`), no matter where your cursor is in that line.

Code that will be refactored or fixed with Quick Fixes this way will be highlighted. Normal Code Actions and non-fix refactorings can still be activated at the cursor location. Make sure to enable _Code Action Widget: Include Nearby Quickfixes_ or configure the `editor.codeActionWidget.includeNearbyQuickfixes` setting.

![Example of new quick fix behavior, showing activation on nearest errors, and showing how all code actions can still be utilized at the cursor location](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/assets/54879025/82995c5a-449e-49a5-8b0e-c837f9a25e34)


## Workbench

### Similar Command results in the Command Palette

Finding the command you're looking for can be challenging. In VS Code alone there are over 2000 commands... and with your favorite extensions, that number can soar even higher. We wanted to introduce a way to help you find what you're looking for while still keeping the speed that the Command Palette offers today. To do this, we are including a new section in the Command Palette results called "similar commands". Here are some examples:

#### A query no longer has to "fuzzily" match to show up in the results. Like "Toggle Auto Save"

!['turn on auto save' and 'Toggle Auto Save' showed up in a similar results section](images/1_83/similar-commands-3.png)

#### If there _are_ fuzzy results though, those still show up at the top and similar commands follow

![user searched for 'change language' and 'Configure Display Language' showed up in a similar results section](images/1_83/similar-commands-2.png)

#### Even extension contribute commands get picked up

![user searched for 'show git blame' and 'toggle file blame' showed up in a similar results section](images/1_83/similar-commands.png)

We think that this will really help those that struggle to remember the exact command name... let's be honest, that's pretty much all of us at some point.

This is just the first cut of this new feature and still requires matching exact words in command names. In the future you can see:
* commands matching based on a non-visible description that the command has
* better basic handling of synonyms ("toggle" and "turn on/off", "show" and "reveal", etc)

Let us know what you think!

### Settings editor search adjustments

The Settings editor now shows fewer results for a given search query to reduce noise.
For users with GitHub Copilot Chat, in addition to settings found by keyword matches, only the top five Copilot Chat setting matches are chosen now, rather than the top fifteen.

The search results are also now ordered by the Settings editor table of contents to show commonly used settings at the top, and to show filtered extension settings in their original order. To revert to ordering the search results by match type and score, set the `workbench.settings.settingsSearchTocBehavior` setting to `"hide"`, clear the search query, and start another search.

![Searching "default formatter" in the Settings editor results in the editor.defaultFormatter setting appearing at the top.](images/1_83/se-default-formatter-search-example.png)

_Theme: [Light Pink](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mgwg.light-pink-theme) (preview on [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev/theme/mgwg.light-pink-theme))_

### Improved overflow behavior for editor actions

When the number of editor actions exceeds the available space, they overflow into the `...` menu. We have refined this logic and some vital actions, like close or split editor, are now excepted. This means that they will always be visible, even if the available space is limited.

### Command Center and Debug Toolbar

There is a new _experimental_ setting that allows you to show the Debug Toolbar inside the Command Center. Make sure to have the command center enabled and configure the `debug.debugToolbarLocation` setting:

```
"debug.toolBarLocation": "commandCenter"
```

![Debug Controls inside Command Center](images/1_83/cc-debugtoolbar.png)

_Theme: [GitHub Light Colorblind (Beta)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme) (preview on [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev/theme/GitHub.github-vscode-theme))_

### Color Theme picker now shows the id next to the theme name

The Color Theme picker now shows the localized name of the color theme and the id next to it. This was done to help users who use a non-English language pack but only know the English name of the theme.

![Color Theme Picker in Korean displaying English theme ids next to the localized name](images/1_83/color-theme-id.png)

### Icons for Profiles

You can now associate an icon with a profile. This icon will be shown in the Activity Bar in the place of settings gear icon. This is useful if you have multiple profiles and want to quickly identify which profile is currently active.

Following picture shows the icon selection dialog while creating a new profile.

![Icon selection dialog](images/1_83/profile-icon-selection.png)

Following picture shows the active profile icon in the Activity Bar.

## Notebooks

### Goto code symbols in notebooks

With the `notebook.gotoSymbols.showAllSymbols` enabled, the goto symbol quickpick will now be populated with all code symbols in the notebook.

### Scrolling on cell execution

You can now configure how much of the next cell is revealed when running `notebook.cell.executeAndSelectBelow` with `shift+enter`: the full next cell, just the first line, or don't scroll at all.

`"notebook.scrolling.revealNextCellOnExecute": "firstLine"` is shown below.

## Contributions to extensions

### GitHub Copilot

#### Improvements to `/tests`

We have improved `/tests` - for panel and inline chat. It is now better in picking up what testing framework you are using and will generate new tests in the same style. Also, it should be much better with suggesting names for new test files, like test_foo.py for foo.py and bar.test.js for bar.js.

#### Inline chat goes multi-turn

Inline chat now keeps all prompts of the current session which enables you to refer to previous messages and to reply to questions.

<video src="images/1_83/chat-history.mp4" controls title="Multi-turn inline chat session"></video>

### Ask GitHub Copilot defaults to the chat view

A few months ago, we introduced an "Ask GitHub Copilot" option in the Command Palette which allowed you to take your query in the command palette and open that in a chat with GitHub Copilot in the event that the options in the Command Palette didn't satify the query.

We gathered feedback on what experience the "Ask GitHub Copilot" option in the Command Palette should open: the chat view in the side bar or Quick Chat. In an effort to make the first time experience more aligned with what folks are more familiar with, we chose the chat view.

<video src="images/1_83/askchat-in-panel.mp4" autoplay loop controls muted title="Ask GitHub Copilot opens in the Chat View"></video>

With that said, if you would like this to open in Quick Chat, we have introduced a setting to do exactly that:
```
"workbench.commandPalette.experimental.askChatLocation": "quickChat"
```

Let us know what you think!

### Command Palette similar commands

This iteration, we shipped the [similar commands](#similar-command-results-in-the-command-palette) feature in the Command Palette. Copilot Chat users get an even better similar commands experience because we can leverage Copilot AI smarts to determine similarity. These smarts help with synonyms, intent and in our testing, Copilot was able to handle similarity across spoken languages as well. Finding the exact command you're looking for in the Command Palette has never been easier!

### Python

#### Python Debugger extension updates

The [Debugpy extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.debugpy), which was [announced a few months ago](/release-notes/v1_80.md#debugpy-extension), has been renamed to "Python Debugger" for improved discoverability in the marketplace.

This extension now includes a new User setting `debugpy.debugJustMyCode` that when disabled, it allows you to step into system or third party libraries code for all your applications -- by default, the debugger steps only into the code that is defined in your own Python code. This was a popular feature request for those who wanted to more conveniently disable `justMyCode` to all of their projects, instead of having to manually configure it in all of their projects' `launch.json` debug configurations.

To try it out, make sure you have the [Python Debugger extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.debugpy) installed. Then open the settings UI (File > Preferences > Settings), search for "debugJustMyCode" and disable the checkbox:

![Searching "debugJustMyCode" in the Settings editor results in the debugpy.debugJustMyCode setting appearing at the top.](images/1_83/debugpy-debug-just-my-code.png)

Now once you create a `launch.json` file, it will use the value of `debugpy.debugJustMyCode` by default, as long as `justMyCode` is not specified in the file. Note that when `justMyCode` is specified, its value will take precedence over the `debugpy.debugJustMyCode` setting.

#### Lint on change option for Pylint extension
By default, the [Pylint extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.pylint) only reports errors and warnings when a file is saved. There's now a new setting called `pylint.lintOnChange` that once set to `true`, will enable the extension to report errors and warnings as you type, without having to save the file.

#### Mypy extension reporting scope and daemon mode
The [Mypy Type Checker extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.mypy-type-checker) has now two new settings to allow you to specify Mypy's reporting scope and whether to use Mypy's daemon.

The first is `mypy-type-checker.reportingScope`, which can be set to `file` (the default) to enable problems to be reported only for open files in the workspace, or `workspace` to enable reporting for all files in the workspace.

The second is `mypy-type-checker.preferDaemon`, which when set to `true`, will use [Mypy's daemon](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/mypy_daemon.html) (`dmypy`) instead of Mypy itself (`mypy`) to perform type checking, which can be much faster in some scenarios.

#### Update on call argument inlay hints setting

Previously, [Pylance](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.vscode-pylance)'s setting to enable inlay hints for partial call arguments (`python.analysis.inlayHints.callArgumentNames`) could only be set to `true` or `false` to enable or disable type hints for call arguments. This setting has been modified to allow more granular control over the type hints that are shown for call arguments.
It can now be set to `partial` to disable hints for [positional-only](https://peps.python.org/pep-0570/) and [keyword-only](https://peps.python.org/pep-3102/) parameters,  `all` to enable them or `off` to disable them completely.

#### Deprecation of Python 3.7 support

As previously mentioned in our [July 2023](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/python/python-in-visual-studio-code-july-2023-release/#upcoming-deprecation-of-python-3-7-support) release blog, we have dropped official Python 3.7 support in the Python extension. There are no plans to actively remove support for Python 3.7, and so we expect the extension will continue to work unofficially with Python 3.7 for the foreseeable future.

Keep in mind, that all other releases of Python are now on an annual release cadence, thus, we expect to stop official support for a Python release once it reaches EOL in the first extension release of the following calendar year (i.e., Python 3.8 is scheduled to reach EOL in October 2024, so the first extension release in 2025 will stop official support).


## Extension Authoring

### Support for Unicode character class escapes in string settings

[Unicode character class escapes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Regular_expressions/Unicode_character_class_escape) are now supported in string and string array settings.
In other words, string settings can now specify a `pattern` field with a value such as `"\\p{Letter}+"`, which allows setting string values that only contain letters.

Support for Unicode character class escapes is not available for object settings with string values at this time.

### Contribute to terminal menus

There are two new menus that can be contributed to `terminal/context` and `terminal/title/context`, which will add entries to the terminal context menu and terminal tab context menu respectively. Example usage:

```jsonc
{
	"contributes": {
		"menus": {
			"terminal/context": [
				{ "command": "terminalTest.sendText" }
			],
			"terminal/title/context": [
				{ "command": "terminalTest.sendText" }
			]
		}
    }
}
```

### New env.onDidChangeShell event

There is a new `env.onDidChangeShell: Event<string>` event that will fire when the value of `env.shell` changes.

### `keytar` is now removed from VS Code

Back in June, [we moved the SecretStorage API over to using Electron's safeStorage](./v1_80.md#secretstorage-api-now-uses-electron-api-over-keytar) and included [a deprecation and removal plan](./v1_80.md#keytar-deprecation-plan) of the now archived and unmaintained [keytar](https://github.com/atom/node-keytar) module from VS Code. We didn't remove `keytar` initially because some extensions were still importing/requiring `keytar` directly (this was recommended before the SecretStorage API existed, but then not recommended when the SecretStorage API was released).

That said, based on telemetry & Insiders builds without `keytar`, the usage of `keytar` has dropped and we are ready to remove `keytar` from VS Code.

#### What does this mean for my extension?

If you use the SecretStorage API, **nothing**. We had been migrating secrets out of `keytar` since June so all of your secrets should be migrated over already if they were touched in the span of two months.

If you are using `keytar` directly in your extension still, there are a couple of options for you to consider:
* _(recommended)_ Use the [SecretStorage API](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api#SecretStorage) that VS Code provides on the [ExtensionContext](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api#ExtensionContext). This API is cross-platform and will work on all platforms that VS Code supports. It is also maintained by the VS Code team and will continue to be maintained and has been a part of the VS Code API for years at this point.
* _(not recommended)_ You can bundle the [keytar](https://github.com/atom/node-keytar) module with your extension. Keep in mind that `keytar` is a native node module which means that you will need to [publish a platform specific extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/publishing-extension#platformspecific-extensions) for each platform you want to support.

#### `--disable-keytar` is now deprecated in favor of `--use-inmemory-secretstorage`

The `--disable-keytar` flag disabled persisting secrets on the machine when the `SecretStorage` API was used. This was primarily used in CI environments that often didn't have a keyring configured because without it, VS Code would throw an error when the `SecretStorage` API was used without a keyring available.

Since we've removed `keytar` this flag needed a new name. We've now marked `--disable-keytar` as deprecated in favor of `--use-inmemory-secretstorage`. In the future we will consider removing `--disable-keytar`, but it's not going away in the near future.

#### Thank you

Lastly, we want to thank all the incredible extension authors that acted quickly to move off of `keytar` and ensure their users have a great and secure experience with secrets in VS Code!

## Engineering

### Floating editor windows exploration

We have started to explore how to allow for editors to be pulled out of the workbench window into their own windows. This feature is our highest upvoted [feature request](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/10121) and we plan to have a first working version for our insiders users to play with in October.

<video src="images/1_83/floating-windows.mp4" autoplay loop controls muted title="Floating Editor Windows"></video>

All editors across all windows operate on the same underlying editor models, so that changes made in one window are reflected live in all other windows. You can create any editor layout in the floating windows and open any editor you like in how many windows you want.

For our first working version we envision that the status bar would also be present in the floating windows so that editor information - such as line numbers and selection ranges - can be shown. Stay tuned for more development in this feature are over the coming months!


### vscode.dev is now cross origin isolated

Cross origin isolation is now enabled for [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev). This enables new powerful features like shared array buffers which is the building block for cross file TypeScript support, Python exeuction in the web, and [vscode-wasm-wasi](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2023/06/05/vscode-wasm-wasi) in general.

### Troubleshooting Settings Sync

We have added a new developer command `Developer: Download Settings Sync Activity` that will download all your settings sync activity on cloud and on your local machine including the logs. This will help us troubleshoot issues with settings sync. We have developed a new view to browse the downloaded activity. You can open the view by running the command `Settings Sync: Show Synced Data` and enabling `SYNC ACTIVITY (DEVELOPER)` view. You can load the downloaded sync activity by clicking on the `Load Sync Activity` button in the view as shown below.

![Sync Activity (Developer) View ](images/1_83/sync-activity-developer-view.png)


## Notable fixes

* [190679](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/190679) Theme color icon.foreground is inconsistent and does not work with `.svg`

## Thank you

Last but certainly not least, a big _**Thank You**_ to the contributors of VS Code.
