## Workbench

### Automatically Fold Imports

Use the setting `editor.foldingImportsByDefault` to have import statements automatically folded. The fold state is stored once a file has been opened once.
The feature works with TypeScript, JavaScript, Java, C# and C++ and with all language that have a folding range provider that annotates import statements with `FoldingRangeKind.Imports`.

### Navigate between folding ranges

New commands are available: `Go to Next Fold` `Go to Previous Fold` and `Go to Parent Fold` set the cursor location to a corresponding fold. The command currently have no default keybinding. Use the
`Keyboard' settings to add keybindings.

### Extended theme customisation syntax

The settings `workbench.colorCustomizations`, `editor.tokenColorCustomizations` and `editor.semanticTokenColorCustomizations` allow users to customize colors of the current theme.

New syntax has been added to customize multiple themes at once:

```
	"workbench.colorCustomizations": {
		"[Abyss][Red]": {
			"activityBar.background": "#ff0000"
		},
		"[Monokai*]": {
			"activityBar.background": "#ff0000"
		}
	},
```

Multiple themes can be listed as well as the `*` wildcard character can be used at the beginning and the end of the name.

## Extension authoring

### Rich Status bar hover

Rich hovers including links and icons are now supported on Status bar item:
`StatusBarItem.tooltip: string | IMarkdownString`

![Rich Status bar hover](images/1_59/rich-statusbar-hover.png)

* If `MarkdownString.supportThemeIcons` is true, you can use icons with the `$(iconName)` syntax.
* If the `MarkdownString` is trusted, you can also add command links. Syntax: `([test](command:vscode.newWindow))`

### Status Bar Warning colors

Status Bar Items that represent warnings can use the newly added colors
`statusBarItem.warningBackground` and `statusBarItem.warningForeground`.
