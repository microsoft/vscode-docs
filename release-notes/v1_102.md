## Chat

### Edit Previous Requests in Chat (Experimental)

You can now click on previous requests to modify the text content, attached context, mode, and model. Upon submitting this change, this will remove all subsequent requests, undo any edits made, and send the new request in chat.

There will be a controlled rollout of different entry points to editing requests, which will help us gather feedback on preferential edit and undo flows. However, users can set their preferred mode with the experiemental `setting(chat.editRequests)` setting:
- `setting(chat.editRequests.inline)`: Hover a request and click on the text to begin an edit inline with the request.
- `setting(chat.editRequests.hover)`: Hover a request to reveal a toolbar with a button to begin an edit inline with the request.
- `setting(chat.editRequests.input)`: Hover a request to reveal a toolbar, which will start edits in the input box at the bottom of chat.

### Terminal auto-approval (Experimental)

Agent mode now has a mechanism for auto approving commands in the terminal. Here's a demo of it using the defaults:

<video src="images/1_102/terminal-auto-approve.mp4" title="Title" autoplay loop controls muted></video>

There are currently two settings: the allow list and the deny list. The allow list is a list of command _prefixes_ or regular expressions that when matched allows the command to be run without explicit approval. For example the following will allow any command starting with `npm run test` to be run, as well as _exactly_ `git status` or `git log`:

```json
"github.copilot.chat.agent.terminal.allowList": {
  "npm run test": true,
  "/^git (status|log)$/": true
}
```

These settings are merge across setting scopes, such that you can have a set of user approved commands as well as workspace-specific approved commands.

As for chained commands we try detect these cases based on the shell and require all sub-commands to be approved. So `foo && bar` we check that both `foo` and `bar` are allowed, only at that point will it run without approval. We also try detect inline commands such as `echo $(pwd)` which would check both `echo $(pwd)` and `pwd`.

The deny list has the same format as the allow list but will override it and force approval. For now this is mainly only of use if you have a broad entry in the allow list and want to block certain commands that is may include. For example the following will allow all commands starting with `npm run` except if it starts with `npm run danger`:

```json
"github.copilot.chat.agent.terminal.allowList": {
  "npm run": true
},
"github.copilot.chat.agent.terminal.denyList": {
  "npm run danger": true
}
```

Thanks to the protections that we gain against prompt injection from [workspace trust](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editing/workspaces/workspace-trust), the philosophy we've approached when implementing this feature with regards to security is to include a small set of innocuous commands in the allow list, and a set of particularly dangerous ones in the deny list just in case they manage to slip through. We're still considering what should be the defaults but here is the current lists:

- Allow list: `echo`, `cd`, `ls`, `cat`, `pwd`, `Write-Host`, `Set-Location`, `Get-ChildItem`, `Get-Content`, `Get-Location`
- Deny list: `rm`, `rmdir`, `del`, `kill`, `curl`, `wget`, `eval`, `chmod`, `chown`, `Remove-Item`

The two major parts we want to add to this feature is a UI entry point to more easily add new commands to the list ([#253268](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/253268)) and an opt-in option to allow an LLM to evaluate the command(s) safety ([#253267](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/253267)). We are also planning on both removing the `github.copilot.` prefix of these settings ([#253314](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/253314)) as well as merging them together ([#253472](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/253472))in the next release before it becomes a preview setting.

### Terminal command simplification

Agent mode sometimes wants runs commands with a `cd` statement just in case. We will now detect this case when it matches the current working directory and simplify the command that is run.

![Asking to run `cd C:\Github\Tyriar\xterm.js && echo hello` only runs `echo hello` when the current working directory already matches](images/1_102/image.png)

### Agent awareness of tasks and terminals

The Copilot agent now understands which background terminals it has created and which tasks are actively running. The agent can read task output using the new `GetTaskOutput` tool. This helps prevent running duplicate tasks and improves workspace context.

![VS Code window showing two build tasks running in the terminal panel. The left terminal displays several errors. The chat agent replies to describe status of my build tasks with a summary of each task's output.](images/1_102/task-status.png)

### Maximized chat view

You can now maximize the secondary sidebar so that it spans over the editor area and hides primary side bar and panel. This state is persisted between restarts and will exit once any editor or view opens.

<video src="images/1_102/auxmax.mp4" title="Maximize secondary sidebar" autoplay loop controls muted></video>

A new icon next to the close button allows you to toggle in and out of this state, or use the new command `workbench.action.toggleMaximizedAuxiliaryBar`.

### Badge indicator when agent needs confirmation to continue

We now show a badge over the application icon in the dock when the window is not focused and the agent needs user confirmation to continue. The badge will disappear as soon as the related window receives focus that triggered it.

![Agent confirmation as badge](./images/1_102/badge.png)

This can be configured via the `setting(chat.notifyWindowOnConfirmation)`.

### Command line support via `code chat <prompt>`

A new subcommand `chat` is added to our VS Code CLI that allows to start a Chat session in the current working directory with the prompt provided:

<video src="images/1_102/chatcli.mp4" title="Chat CLI" autoplay loop controls muted></video>

The basic syntax is `code chat [options] [prompt]` and options can be any of:
* `-m --mode <mode>`: The mode to use for the chat session. Available options: 'ask', 'edit', 'agent', or the identifier of a custom mode. Defaults to 'agent'
* `-a --add-file <path>`: Add files as context to the chat session
* `--maximize`: Maximize the chat session view
* `-r --reuse-window`: Force to use the last active window for the chat session
* `-n --new-window`: Force to open an empty window for the chat session

Reading from stdin is supported, provided you pass in `-` at the end, for example `ps aux | grep code | code chat <prompt> -`

### Fetch Tool supports non-HTTP URLs

We've seen that on occation models will want to call the Fetch Tool with non-HTTP URLs, such as `file://` URLs. Rather than disallowing this, the Fetch Tool now supports these URLs and will return the content of the file or resource at the URL. Images are also supported.

### Clearer language model access management

We've reworked the UX around managing extension access to language models provided by extensions. Previously, you saw an item in the Account menu that said `AccountName (GitHub Copilot Chat)`... this had nothing to do with what account GitHub Copilot Chat was using but rather allowed you to manage which extensions had access to the language models provided by Copilot Chat.

To make this clearer, we've removed the `AccountName (GitHub Copilot Chat)` item and replaced it with a new item called `Manage Language Model Access...`. This item will open a quick pick that allows you to manage which extensions have access to the language models provided by GitHub Copilot Chat.

![Language Model Access Quick Pick](images/1_102/lm-access-qp.png)

We think this is clearer... that said in a future release we will be exploring more granular access control for language models (only allowing specific models rather than _all_ models provided by an extension), so stay tuned for that.

## Accessibility

### Keep all edits from within the editor

Formerly, to accept all edits, focus would need to be in the panel chat. Now, with focus in the editor, you can run the command **Keep All Edits** `kb(chatEditor.action.acceptAllEdits)`.

### User action required sound

We’ve fine-tuned the accessibility signal to indicate when chat requires user action and set the default value to `auto`, so screen reader users will hear this. You can configure this behavior with `setting(accessibility.signals.chatUserActionRequired)`.

### Alert when rendering errors occur in chat

Previously, screen reader users were not alerted when a chat rendering error would occur. Users are now alerted with this information and can also focus it via keyboard.

## Editor Experience

### Scroll on middle click

**Setting**: `setting(editor.scrollOnMiddleClick:true)`

Scroll the editor by simply clicking, or holding down your middle mouse button (the scroll wheel) and moving around.

Once activated, the cursor changes to a panning icon and moving the mouse up or down then smoothly scrolls the editor in that direction. The scrolling speed is determined by how far you move the mouse from the initial click point. Release the middle mouse button or click it again to stop scrolling and return to the standard cursor.

![Screenshot of the editor scrolling when the middle mouse button is clicked.](images/1_102/middle-scroll.png)

**Known Conflicts**

Enabling this feature interferes with other actions tied to the middle mouse button. For example, if you have column selection (`setting(editor.columnSelection)`) enabled, holding down the middle mouse button selects text. Similarly, on Linux, selection clipboard (`setting(editor.selectionClipboard)`) pastes content from your clipboard when the middle mouse button is clicked.

To avoid these conflicts, please enable only one of these settings at a time.

### Settings search suggestions (Preview)

**Setting**: `setting(workbench.settings.showAISearchToggle:true)`

This milestone, we modified the sparkle toggle in the Settings editor so that it acts as a toggle between the AI and non-AI search results. The AI settings search results are semantically similar results instead of results that are based on string matching. For example, `editor.fontSize` appears as an AI settings search result when you search for "increase text size".

The toggle is enabled only when there are AI results available. We welcome feedback on when the AI settings search did not find an expected setting, and we plan to enable the setting by default over the next iteration.

### Windows accent color

**Setting**: `setting(window.border)`

VS Code on Windows now supports the accent color as border around the window frame if that is enabled in Windows settings ("Show accent color on title bars and window borders"):

![Screenshot of window accent color](images/1_102/window-accent.png)

A new setting `setting(window.border)` allows to either disable this color (`off`) or allows you to pick any color you like.

_Note:_ the border will only be visible when the related Windows setting is enabled. It can not yet be set per workspace, but we are working on that support.

## Terminal

### Terminal Suggest (Preview) improvements

#### Selection Mode

A new setting, `terminal.integrated.suggest.selectionMode`, helps you understand that by default, `kbStyle(Tab)` (not `kbStyle(Enter)`) accepts suggestions. You can choose between `partial`, `always`, and `never` modes to control how suggestions are selected and accepted.

`partial` is the default value, which means that `kbStyle(Tab)` will accept the suggestion until navigation has occurred.

![The first terminal suggestion can be accepted with Tab](images/1_102/terminal-selection-mode.png)

#### Learn more

The **Learn More** action `(kb(workbench.action.terminal.suggestLearnMore))` in the terminal suggest widget status bar is now highlighted for the first 10 times or if the widget is shown for 10 seconds. This helps you discover how to configure, disable, and read about the suggest widget.

![The Learn More action appears in the terminal suggest widget status bar](images/1_102/terminal-suggest-discoverability.png)

#### Multi-command support

Terminal suggest now supports multi-command lines. You can link commands with `;`, `&&`, and other shell operators, and receive suggestions for all commands on the line.

![VS Code terminal showing a multi-command line with git commit and git push, and the terminal suggest widget displaying suggestions for pull, push, and other git commands.](images/1_102/terminal-suggest-multi.png)

#### Symlink information

We now display a symlink's realpath in the suggest details widget and have unique icons for symlink files and folders to help distinguish them from other suggestions.

![Terminal suggest shows the symlink's path -> real path](images/1_102/terminal-symlink.png)

#### Improved sorting

We've improved sorting in many ways - for example, giving `main` and `master` priority over other branches.

![Terminal suggest boosts main and master compared to other branch suggestions that start with ma](images/1_102/terminal-suggest-sorting.png)

#### Git bash improvements

We now properly support Git Bash path completions for folders and files. Additionally, we source the builtin commands and present them as suggestions.

![In a Git Bash terminal, suggestions show builtin functions like cat, cp, and curl](images/1_102/terminal-git-bash.png)

## Remote Development


## Contributions to extensions

### Python

#### Python Environments extension improvements

The [Python Environments extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.vscode-python-envs) received several improvements this release:

-  We've polished terminal activation support for Poetry versions greater than 2.0.0
-  You can now use the Quick Create environment creation option to set up multiple virtual environments which are uniquely named within the same workspace
- The generated .venv folders are now git-ignored by default
- We've improved the environment deletion process

#### Python Environments included as part of the Python extension
We're starting to roll-out the [Python Environments extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.vscode-python-envs) as an optional dependency with the Python extension. What this means is you may now begin seeing the Python Environments extension automatically installed along side the Python extension, similar to the Python Debugger and Pylance extensions. This controlled rollout allows us to gather early feedback and ensure reliability before general availability.

The Python Environments extension includes all the core capabilities we've introduced so far including: [one-click environment setup using Quick Create](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/python/python-in-visual-studio-code-may-2025-release/#python-environments-quick-create-command), automatic terminal activation (via "python-envs.terminal.autoActivationType" setting), and all supported [UI for environment and package management](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/python/python-in-visual-studio-code-december-2024-release/).

To use the Python Environments extension during the roll-out, make sure the extension is installed and add the following to your VS Code settings.json file:

```json
"python.useEnvironmentsExtension": true
```

#### Disabled PyREPL for Python 3.13

We have disabled PyREPL for Python 3.13 and above to address indentation and cursor issues in the interactive terminal. For more details, see [Disable PyREPL for >= 3.13](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-python/issues/25164).

#### Experimental Pylance MCP Tools

The [Pylance extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.vscode-pylance) now includes several experimental MCP tools, which offer access to Pylance's documentation, import analysis, environment management, and more. These tools are currently available in the Pylance prerelease version and are still early in development. While they offer new capabilities, we know it can be challenging to call them directly today. We are actively working to make these tools easier to use and more valuable in future updates. Your feedback in the [pylance-release](https://github.com/microsoft/pylance-release/) repository is welcome as we continue to improve the experience.

### GitHub Authentication

#### Revamped GitHub Sign In Flow

This iteration we have revamped the GitHub sign in flow by defaulting to a loopback URL flow rather than a flow that uses a `vscode://` protocol URL. This change is to improve the reliability of the sign in flow and to ensure that it works across all platforms, including those that do not support custom URL schemes.

When you sign in with GitHub, you will now be redirected to a loopback URL that looks like `http://localhost:PORT/`. This will allow the sign in flow to complete successfully without relying on custom URL schemes. That said, once landing on the loopback URL, you will still be redirected to a `vscode://` URL to return you to VS Code but this doesn't need to resolve for the sign in flow to complete successfully.

In other words, we get the best of both worlds: a reliable sign in flow that works across all platforms and a return to VS Code that uses the `vscode://` URL scheme.

While we were at it, we also gave this page that we land on a fresh coat of paint. In future iterations, we'll apply this new design to other sign in experiences.

## Extension Authoring

### Allow to open files when using `vscode.openFolder` command

Extensions that call the `vscode.openFolder` command can now pass `filesToOpen?: UriComponents[]` as options to select files to open in the workspace window that opens.

Example:

```ts
vscode.commands.executeCommand('vscode.openFolder', <folder uri>, { filesToOpen: [ /* files to open */]});
```

## Proposed APIs


## Engineering

### CSS minification using `esbuild`

VS Code has been using `esbuild` for bundling and minifying the JavaScript sources for a long time. We now also use `esbuild` to bundle and minify our CSS files.

### Strict layer checks using `tsconfig.json`

We now use multiple `tsconfig.json` files to ensure our source code adheres to our [target environment rules](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/Source-Code-Organization#target-environments). Our CI runs `npm run valid-layers-check` and will fail the build if for example a type was added into a `browser` layer that only exists in the `node` runtime.

### `vscode-bisect` for sanity testing

The [`vscode-bisect`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-bisect) project has been around for a long time allowing to find regressions in VS Code builds (what `git bisect` does for `git`). We added a new `--sanity` option that allows us to quickly go through our [sanity check](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/Sanity-Check) that is mandatory before we release a new build.

### Redesigned landing page for authentication redirects

When you go through an authentication flow with for example GitHub, you will now be redirected to a redesigned landing page to focus back into your VS Code session.

![Redesigned authentication landing page](./images/1_102/auth-landing.png)
