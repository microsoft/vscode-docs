Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the June 1.102 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the June milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/main)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A%22June+2025%22)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.

## Editor Experience

### Scroll on middle click

**Setting**: `setting(editor.scrollOnMiddleClick:true)`

Scroll the editor by simply clicking, or holding down your middle mouse button (the scroll wheel) and moving around.

Once activated, the cursor changes to a panning icon and moving the mouse up or down then smoothly scrolls the editor in that direction. The scrolling speed is determined by how far you move the mouse from the initial click point. Release the middle mouse button or click it again to stop scrolling and return to the standard cursor.

**Known Conflicts**

Enabling this feature interferes with other actions tied to the middle mouse button. For example, if you have column selection (`setting(editor.columnSelection)`) enabled, holding down the middle mouse button selects text. Similarly, on Linux, selection clipboard (`setting(editor.selectionClipboard)`) pastes content from your clipboard when the middle mouse button is clicked.

To avoid these conflicts, please enable only one of these settings at a time.
