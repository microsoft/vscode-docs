# June 2022 (version 1.69)

<!-- DOWNLOAD_LINKS_PLACEHOLDER -->

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the June 1.69 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the June milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/main)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22June+2022%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.

## Workbench

### Settings editor indicator area changes and language overrides

The Settings editor now shows when a setting has a language override. For context, language overrides always take precedence over non-language-specific overrides, so if the value of a setting doesn't seem to affect the behaviour of the setting for a certain type of file, it could be that the setting has a language override.

The indicator text has changed a bit in general to be more clear and concise. The screencap below shows the new Modified elsewhere indicator. Hovering over the indicator reveals a custom hover that shows language overrides, when applicable. The screencap later shows the new default override indicator with the text "Default value changed".

### Command Center

The command center has been polished and is now ready to be tried. Enable it via `window.commandCenter`-setting.

### Consistent Menu Scaling

In some cases, depending on your platform, the title bar does not scale with the rest of the workbench. Previously, menus originating from the title bar would also not match the scaling of the rest of the workbench. Now, all menus should have consistent scaling regardless of your `window.zoomLevel`-setting value.

### 3-Way Merge Editor
In this release, we continued working on the 3-way merge editor.
This feature can be enabled by setting `git.mergeEditor` to `true` and will be enabled by default in future releases.

The merge editor allows to quickly resolve git merge conflicts. When enabled, the merge editor can be opened by clicking on a conflicting file in the SCM view. Checkboxes can be used to accept and combine changes in *Theirs* or *Yours*:

![Merge Editor Conflict Resolution Demo](./images/1_69/merge-editor.gif)

All language features are available in the merge editor (including diagnostics, breakpoints and tests), so you get immediate feedback about any issues in the merged result.

The result can also be edited directly. Note how the checkbox update as expected:

![Editing the result directly updates the checkbox states](./images/1_69/merge-editor2.gif)

When closing the merge editor or accepting the merge, a warning is shown if not all conflicts have been reacted on.

The merge editor supports word-level merging - as long as the changes don't intersect, both sides can be applied. In case the insertion order matters, it can be swapped. At any time, the conflict can also be resolved manually.

![Accepting both sides of a merge conflict](./images/1_69/merge-editor3.gif)

We would love to hear your feedback! To share a merge conflict with us, please use the command `Merge Editor (Dev): Copy Contents of Inputs, Base and Result from JSON` and paste the content in your GitHub issue.

## Terminal

### Shell integration

Shell integration for PowerShell, bash and zsh that has been in preview since the January releave is now out of preview! We're planning on enabling it by default in v1.70. Enable the setting to turn the feature on:

```json
"terminal.integrated.shellIntegration.enabled": true
```

Shell integration allows VS Code's terminal to understand more of what's going on inside the shell in order to enable more features. One of the goals we tried to accomplish with shell integration was to get it working with _zero configuration required_ to lower the bar to entry for the terminal. This was achieved by automatically "injecting" the shell integration script into the shell session via shell arguments and/or environment variables when the setting is enabled. There are some cases where this does not work such as in sub-shells or some complex shell setups, but we also have a manual install route for those more advanced cases.

See below for a summary of the features shell integration currently enables:

#### Command decorations and the overview ruler

One of the things shell integration enables is the ability to get the exit codes of the commands run within the terminal. Using this information, decorations are added to the left of the line to indicate whether the command succeeded of failed. These decorations also show up in the relatively new overview ruler in the scroll bar, just like in the editor.

![Blue circles appear next to successful commands, red circles with crosses appear next to failed commands. The color of the circles appears in the scroll bar](images/1_69/terminal-si-decorations.png)

The decorations can be interacted with to give some contextual actions like re-running the command:

![Clicking a successful command decoration shows a context menu containing items: Copy Output, Copy Output as HTML, Rerun Command and How does this work?]((images/1_69/terminal-si-decoration-menu.png)

The command decorations can be configured with the following settings:

- `terminal.integrated.shellIntegration.decorationIcon`
- `terminal.integrated.shellIntegration.decorationIconSuccess`
- `terminal.integrated.shellIntegration.decorationIconError`

#### Command navigation

The commands detected by shell integration feed into the command navigation feature (`ctrl/cmd+up`, `ctrl/cmd+down`) to give it more reliable command positions. This feature enables quick navigation between commands and selection of their output.

![Ctrl+up and ctrl+down will navigate up and down between commands, ctrl+shift+up and ctrl+shift+down will do the same but also select between the 2 locations. To use this feature in screen readers it currently requires custom keybindings](images/1_69/terminal-si-command-nav.gif)

#### Run recent command

The `Terminal: Run Recent Command` command surfaces history from various sources in a quick pick, providing similar functionality to a shell's reverse search (ctrl+r). The sources are the current session's history, previous session history for this shell type and the common shell history file.

![The "run recent command" command shows a quick pick with commands ran previously that can be filtered similar to the go to file command](images/1_69/terminal-si-recent-command.png)

Some other functionality of the command:
- In the current session section there is a clipboard icon in the right of the quick pick which will open the command output in an editor.
- `Alt` can be held to write the text to the terminal without running it.
- The amount of history stored in the previous session section is determined by the `terminal.integrated.shellIntegration.history` setting.

There is currently no keybinding assigned by default but it can be hooked up to `ctrl+space` for example with the following keybinding:

```json
{
    "key": "ctrl+space",
    "command": "workbench.action.terminal.runRecentCommand",
    "when": "terminalFocus"
},
```

#### Go to recent directory

Similar to the run recent command feature, the `Terminal: Go to Recent Directory` command keeps track of directories that have been visited and allows quick filtering and `cd`ing to them:

![The "go to recent directory" command shows a quick pick with directories previously navigated to, selecting one will run "cd <path>"](images/1_69/terminal-si-go-to-dir.gif)

`Alt` can be held to write the text to the terminal without running it.

#### Current working directory detection

Shell integration tells us what the current working directory is. This information was impossible on Windows previously without a bunch of hacks and required polling on macOS and Linux which isn't good for performance.

The current working directory is used to resolve links against, showing the directory a recent command ran within as well as the `"terminal.integrated.splitCwd": "inherited"` feature.

#### Growing support for shell setups

This release we improved integration with `bash-preexec`, added basic support for powerlevel10k and detected more cases where shell integration will not work and gracefully disable the feature. We expect a longtail of improvements in this area over time.

### SetMark sequence support

The terminal now supports the sequence `OSC 1337 ; SetMark ST` originally created by ITerm2, making it possible to add a mark on the left of the line as well as in the scroll bar:

![When the sequence is written to the terminal a small grey circle will appear to the left of the command, with a matching annotation in the scroll bar](images/1_69/terminal-setmark.png)

_Theme: [Sapphire Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Tyriar.theme-sapphire)_

Here are some examples of how to trigger this in scripts:

- bash: `echo -e 'Mark this line\x1b]1337;SetMark\x07'`
- pwsh: ``Write-Host "Mark this line`e]1337;SetMark`a"``

### Custom rendering of simple powerline glyphs

The 4 common angled bracket powerline symbols are now custom rendered similar to [box drawing and block characters](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_60#_custom-rendering-of-box-drawing-and-block-element-characters) when GPU acceleration is enabled in the terminal. This comes with several benefits:

- Sub-pixel anti-aliasing will never be used which could cause unsightly red or blue outlines on either side, breaking up the "powerline".
- These characters will work without installing a patched font.
- Line height affects these characters.

Before:

![Line height would not be respected, leading to a powerline symbol with a different height to adjacent cells. Additionally, a blue outline could appear when sub-pixel anti-aliasing was used](images/1_69/terminal-powerline-before.png)

After:

![Line height is now respected and greyscale anti-aliasing is used for improved rendering](images/1_69/terminal-powerline-after.png)

### Consistent format for messages from VS Code

Previously messages in the terminal that were directly written by VS Code, not the process, use several different formats. This is now consistent across the board with loud format and a more subtle format:

![Loud formatting starts the line with an asterisk with the inverted style, followed by a message using a blue background](images/1_69/terminal-message-loud.png)
![Subtle formatting starts the line with an asterisk with the inverted style, followed by a message using the default background](images/1_69/terminal-message-subtle.png)

### Accessibility improvements

### Reconnection improvements

## Debugging

### Unbound breakpoint warning icon in Javascript debugging

If you are debugging a TS/JS project and having trouble configuring sourcemaps or getting your breakpoints to bind, we will now show a hint message in the breakpoints view with a link for the Javascript debugger's breakpoint troubleshooting tool. You will also see the hint when hovering the gray breakpoint icon in the editor.

![hovering the breakpoint warning icon](images/1_69/bp-hover.png)

When the API to show this hint is finalized, other debuggers will be able to show the hint with their own appropriate message.

### New Ways to Navigate the Debug Console
#### Console Access Through the Quick Access Menu
There is now a Quick Access menu to view a list of your debug consoles! In the menu, you can select a console name to show it in the bottom panel. Here, you can search and filter through your console names.

![filtering and selecting a debug console from the quick access](images/1_69/debug-filter-and-select.gif)

_Theme: [GitHub Dark Dimmed](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme)_

There are two ways to access this Quick Access menu:

1. Typing `?` in the Quick Pick menu (`CTRL`+`P`), then selecting the option to view debug consoles.

![go to quick access](images/1_69/goto-debug-quickaccess.gif)

OR

2. Manually typing out `debug consoles ` in the Quick Pick.

#### Console Access Through the View Menu
You can also access a list of Debug Consoles from within the existing view menu. Type `view ` in the Quick Pick menu and scroll down to the `Panel/Debug Console` header. You can see a list of debug consoles here too.

![accessing the debug console via view menu](images/1_69/debug-view-menu.gif)

#### Toggling Between Consoles
You can now use `CTRL`+`PgUp` to navigate to the previous debug console and `CTRL`+`PgDn` to go to the next console. On macOS, this is `CMD`+`SHIFT`+`[` and `CMD`+`SHIFT`+`]`, respectively.

### Loaded Scripts Search and Filtering
Previously, you could only view your loaded scripts within a tree view from the Run and Debug menu. Now, you can simply search and navigate to one using our new `Debug: Open Loaded Script...` command. It works just like the `Go to File...` command, but you can navigate to a loaded script!
