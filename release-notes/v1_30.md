## Workbench

### Multiline search input

Last month, we added support for multiline search. This month we improved the search UX to make it easier to use. Now, you can search with multiline text without having to write a regular expression. Type `Shift+Enter` in the search box to insert a newline, and the search box will grow to show your full multiline query. You can also copy and paste a multiline selection from the editor into the search box.

![multiline search input](images/1_30/multiline-input.png)

### Custom title and menu bar on Linux by default

Over several releases, we have been improving the accessibility and themability of menus on Windows via the custom title and menu bar. While it was optionally available on Linux, in this release it will now be enabled by default.

![Custom title and menu bar on Linux](images/1_30/custom-title-menu-linux.png)

To use the native title bar, you can set the `window.titleBarStyle` to `native`.

### Scrolling menus

With the custom menu bar enabled, menus are restricted to being rendered within the VS Code window. Previously, menus could be cut off by the boundaries of the window. This has now been address by making context menus scrollable when needed.

![Scrolling menus](images/1_30/scrolling-menus.gif)

### Menu bar overflow menu

The menu bar also has a new overflow menu (**...**) when your window width is not enough for both the menu bar and your window title.

![Menu bar overflow](images/1_30/menu-bar-overflow.png)

### Moved Settings editor actions

The Settings editor actions (**Open settings.json**, **Show modified settings**, etc.) have been moved from the **...** menu inside the Settings editor to the editor title bar. This makes them consistent with other editor types, and **Open settings.json** is now just one click away with the curly braces `{}` button. The Keyboard Shortcuts editor has made the same change.

![settings editor actions](images/1_30/settings-actions.png)

### References view

The References view has been polished and is no longer a preview feature. There are now two commands:

* **Find All References** which opens the References view.
* **Peek References** which opens references in a Peek view.

The References view is hidden at startup but will remain visible once it has been used. If all search results are cleared, it shows a history of previous searches.

![References View](images/1_30/references-viewlet.png)

There is now a results summary at the top of the view and a context menu to clear and copy results. Many bugs were fixed and the overall stability has been improved.

## Editor

### Snippet comment variables

There are new snippet variables that insert line or block comments, honoring the current language. Use `BLOCK_COMMENT_START` and  `BLOCK_COMMENT_END` for block comments and `LINE_COMMENT` otherwise.

The snippet below inserts `/* Hello World */` in JavaScript files and `<!-- Hello World -->` in HTML files

```json
{
    "hello": {
        "scope": "javascript,html",
        "prefix": "hello",
        "body": "$BLOCK_COMMENT_START Hello World $BLOCK_COMMENT_END"
    }
}
```

### Declaration versus definition

Until now, VS Code offered commands for displaying the definition of a symbol, for example **Go to Definition** and **Peek Definition**. This didn't take into account the fact that some languages differentiate, stricter than others, between the **declaration** and the **definition** of a symbol. We have fixed that and there are now commands **Go to Declaration** and **Peek Declaration** for the declaration of a symbol.

![Go to Declaration](images/1_30/go-to-declaration.png)

The data required for language features like **Go to Declaration** is computed by extensions and there is a new API, which you can read about in the [Extension Authoring](#extension-authoring) section.

### Smooth cursor animation

There is a new setting, `editor.cursorSmoothCaretAnimation`, which will enable a transition animation whenever the cursor is moved.

## Git integration

### Change default click action

You can now change the default action when you click on a file in the Source Control view. By default, VS Code will open the Diff view but by setting `git.openDiffOnClick` to `false`, the file will open in a regular editor.

### Push or sync on commit

A new setting `git.postCommitCommand` allows you to either push or sync your repository after a commit. The available values are `none` (default), `push`, and `sync`.

## Languages

### TypeScript 3.2

VS Code now includes [TypeScript 3.2.2](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-3-2/). This release brings some exciting new language features, including [strict typing of `bind`, `call`, and `apply`](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-3-2/#strictbindcallapply), and [BigInt support](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-3-2/#bigint). The TypeScript update also fixes some important bugs and includes new tooling features and improvements

### Improved display of JavaScript and TypeScript callbacks

JavaScript and TypeScript anonymous callbacks were all previously labeled as `<function>` in the Outline view, breadcrumbs view, and document symbol list. This made it impossible to tell which function you were really after:

![VS Code 1.29 with <function> entries in the Outline view](images/1_30/ts-old-callback-nav.png)

With TypeScript 3.2+, VS Code now displays more context for callback functions so that you can tell them apart:

![VS Code 1.30 with much more helpful labels](images/1_30/ts-new-callback-nav.png)

### Renames handle JS/TS destructuring properly

Renames now handle JavaScript and TypeScript destructuring and will introduce an alias if needed:

![Rename with destructuring](images/1_30/ts-rename.gif)

### Adding missing new JS/TS Quick Fix

Forget a `new` when instantiating a class? TypeScript 3.2 brings a new Quick Fix to help out:

![The add missing 'new' quick fix](images/1_30/ts-new-quickfix.gif)

This Quick Fix works in TypeScript and in [type checked JavaScript](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/javascript#_type-checking).

### File icons for JS/TS path suggestions

Building on [work in VS Code 1.29](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_29#_file-and-folder-icons-in-intellisense), the IntelliSense widget now shows file icons for JavaScript and TypeScript path suggestions:

![Icons in path IntelliSense](images/1_30/ts-import-icons.png)

### Highlighting of Markdown elements in JSDoc comments

Fenced code blocks and other Markdown elements inside of JSDoc blocks are now syntax highlighted:

![JSDoc Syntax highlighting ](images/1_30/ts-markdown-jsdocs.png)

This inline highlighting better matches VS Code's Markdown rendering of JSDoc for hovers and IntelliSense documentation.

## Debugging

### Simplified initial debug configuration

This milestone we looked into simplifying the generated `launch.json` file for our most popular debug extensions. Our goal was to make it easier for users to start and configure debugging. This meant hiding unnecessary launch configuration attributes and using the Quick Pick UI for better user interaction while generating the initial `launch.json`. More details about this effort can be found in [issue #62851](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/62851).

### Debug consoles can be deleted

As of last milestone when debugging multiple debug sessions, we show multiple debug consoles, one for each session. Now it is possible to delete these consoles when the corresponding session is no longer active by clearing the content of that debug console. We did not add explicit commands for managing the lifecycle of a debug console, because we believe the current approach will be more intuitive and easier to use.

### Improved user input variables for debug configurations

We have improved and generalized the concept of `launch.json` variables that prompt for user input. You can find the details in the [Tasks](#improved-user-input-variables-for-task-and-debug-configurations) section.

### Debugging from the Process Explorer

It's now possible to start debugging Node.js processes from the VS Code Process Explorer (**Developer: Open Process Explorer**) using the **Debug** context menu action.

Below you can see attaching to a Node.js process started from the Integrated Terminal.

![debugging a Node.js process started from the terminal](images/1_30/debug-from-process-explorer.gif)

## Node/Chrome debugging

### `smartStep` now enabled by default

A few releases ago, we [changed the behavior](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_26#_changed-smartstep-behavior-for-nodechrome-debugging) of `smartStep` to make it more useful. Using `smartStep` results in a much better debugging experience, especially for TypeScript, so we have changed the behavior to be always on.

### Automatic default for `localRoot`

In Node.js remote debugging scenarios, the debug configuration attribute `localRoot` now automatically defaults to `${workspaceFolder}` and only `remoteRoot` needs to be specified.

## Tasks

### Run on folder open

If you have a task that you always run when you open a folder, you can configure it to run automatically when that folder is opened by configuring its `"runOn"` property. We found this useful for making sure no one breaks our new strict null checks in the VS Code repository. By adding `"runOn": "folderOpen"`, everyone who allows tasks to be run automatically will get markers when they violate the strict null check:

```json
{
    "type": "npm",
    "script": "strict-null-check-watch",
    "label": "TS - Strict Null Checks",
    "isBackground": true,
    "problemMatcher": {
        "base": "$tsc-watch",
        "owner": "typescript-strict-null",
        "applyTo": "allDocuments"
    },
    "runOptions": {
        "runOn": "folderOpen"
    }
}
```

### Clear task terminal

To clear the terminal before executing a task, you can configure the task’s `presentation` options with `"clear": true`.

```json
{
    "type": "gulp",
    "task": "tslint",
    "label": "Run tslint",
    "presentation": {
        "clear": true
    }
}
```

### Rerun tasks

Tasks can now be rerun using the **Tasks: Rerun Last Task** command (`workbench.action.tasks.reRunTask`). By default, a rerun task will re-evaluate its run variables, including its inputs. To use the variables that have already been evaluated in the previous run, configure the `"reevaluateOnRerun"` option:

```json
{
    "type": "gulp",
    "task": "tslint",
    "label": "Run tslint",
    "runOptions": {
        "reevaluateOnRerun": false
    }
}
```

### Improved user input variables for task and debug configurations

For a long time VS Code has supported [variable substitution](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/variables-reference) in `tasks.json` and `launch.json` via the `${variableName}` syntax.

For `launch.json`, it was even possible to use variables that prompt for user input (for example `${command:pickNodeProcess}` which opens a Quick Pick based process picker). This feature was not available for `tasks.json` and the command based variables had other limitations too (see issues [#9297](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9297), [#9544](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/9544), and [#30588](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/30588)).

In this milestone, user input variables have been generalized and improved and they are now available for `launch.json` **and** `tasks.json`. This work has also brought the command syntax to `tasks.json`.

For user input variables, we introduced a new variable category `input`, which results in this syntax: `${input:variableName}`. This simple syntax is not sufficient to present meaningful UI to the end user, so we've introduced a new `inputs` section in `launch.json` and `tasks.json`, where additional configuration attributes are specified.

Example using Angular CLI:

![Tasks input](images/1_30/input-example.gif)

Here is the list of supported attributes:

* `id` - The corresponding variable name for which these attributes are used.
* `type` - The type of user input widget. In this release, `promptString` (for a string InputBox) and `pickString` (for a string Quick Pick) are supported.
* `description` - Descriptive text shown to the user.
* `default` - The default value to use if the user just presses **Enter**.

A first example shows how to use a user input variable in a task configuration (`tasks.json`):

```json
{
    "tasks": [
        {
            "label": "Echo input",
            "type": "shell",
            "command": "echo ${input:echoPrompt}"
        }
    ],
    "inputs": [
        {
            "id": "echoPrompt",
            "description": "Please enter a value",
            "default": "default echo text",
            "type": "promptString"
        }
    ]
}
```

Another example shows a user input variable for selecting between two options in a debug configuration (`launch.json`):

```json
{
    "configurations": [
        {
            "type": "node",
            "request": "launch",
            "name": "Launch Program",
            "program": "${workspaceFolder}/${input:pickProgram}"
        }
    ],
    "inputs": [
        {
            "id": "pickProgram",
            "description": "Select client or server",
            "type": "pickString",
            "options": ["client.js", "server.js"],
            "default": "client.js"
        }
    ]
}
```

We plan to combine **user input variables** with the existing command-based variables so that user input variables can be contributed by extensions.

## Extensions

### Install previous versions

You can now go back to a previous version of an extension if there are issues with the current version. VS Code provides an **Install Another Version** action on an installed extension which shows a dropdown of available versions.

![Downgrade Extension](images/1_30/downgrade-Extension.gif)

### Unresponsive extension host

VS Code runs extensions in a separate Node.js process – the extension host. This isolates extension code from VS Code itself, but it doesn’t isolate different extensions from each other. Due to the single threaded nature of JavaScript, an extension can, willingly or not, monopolize the extension host thread, block all other extensions, and make operations appear unresponsive.

VS Code now monitors the extension host and when it becomes unresponsive, VS Code starts profiling the extension host. When an extension is identified as being the cause of the unresponsiveness, a minimized notification is shown that encourages the user to file an issue:

![Slow Extension Identified](images/1_30/exthost-slow-the-movie.gif)

As a **user**, keep an eye on the bell icon in the Status Bar as the notification is small. As an **extension author**, if you receive an unresponsive issue, please review this [guide](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/wiki/Explain:-extension-causes-high-cpu-load) which explains what has happened and how to open the CPU-profile attached to the issue.

## Preview Features

Preview features are not ready for release but are functional enough to use. We welcome your early feedback while they are under development.

### HTML custom tags / attributes support

The new `html.experimental.custom.tags` and `html.experimental.custom.attributes` settings allows you to specify a list of tags and attributes that VS Code loads during startup. When you are editing HTML files, VS Code will offer auto-completion and hover for those tags and attributes. This works great with [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Web_Components), for example:

![HTML custom tags and attributes](images/1_30/html-custom-tag-attribute.gif)

You can open [octref/web-components-examples](https://github.com/octref/web-components-examples) repository to test this feature. This feature is **in preview and both the setting names and JSON format are subject to change**.

If you have feedback or feature requests, please follow up in issue [#62976](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/62976).

### Network proxy support for extensions

There is an experimental setting `Http: Proxy Support` for enabling network proxy support for all extensions. While we are still working on some of the details, we invite you to give it a try and [let us know](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/60773) if it works for you. (Note that enabling the network proxy support currently [breaks](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/64133) the GitHub Pull-Request extension's sign-in.)

![HTTP Proxy Support](images/1_30/http-proxy-support.png)

Setting it to `override` should work best for most setups, try `on` for comparison when that doesn't work well.

## Extension Authoring

### Go To Declaration

We have added a `DeclarationProvider` interface which extensions can implement to support the **Go to Declaration** feature. Declaration providers should return locations that are the declaration of a symbol. When multiple providers are registered for the same file, then their results are merged.

### Signature Help Context

SignatureHelpProviders now take a `context` parameter that provides information about how signature help was triggered. The context includes:

* How signature help was triggered (trigger character, a command, or a document context change).
* The character that caused signature help to be triggered.
* Was signature help previously showing when it was triggered?

```typescript
import * as vscode from 'vscode';

export function activate(context: vscode.ExtensionContext) {
    vscode.languages.registerSignatureHelpProvider('markdown', new class implements vscode.SignatureHelpProvider {
        provideSignatureHelp(
            document: vscode.TextDocument,
            position: vscode.Position,
            token: vscode.CancellationToken,
            context: vscode.SignatureHelpContext
        ): vscode.ProviderResult<vscode.SignatureHelp> {
            // Return fake signature help result
            const sigHelp = new vscode.SignatureHelp();
            sigHelp.activeParameter = 0;
            sigHelp.activeSignature = 0;
            sigHelp.signatures = [new vscode.SignatureInformation(getLabel(context))];
            return sigHelp;
        }
    }, {
        triggerCharacters: ['('],
        retriggerCharacters: [',']
    });
}

function getLabel(context: vscode.SignatureHelpContext): string {
    const parts = [];
    // How was signature help triggered
    switch (context.triggerKind) {
        case vscode.SignatureHelpTriggerKind.Invoke:            parts.push('invoke'); break;
        case vscode.SignatureHelpTriggerKind.ContentChange:     parts.push('change'); break;
        case vscode.SignatureHelpTriggerKind.TriggerCharacter:  parts.push('character'); break;
    }

    // The character (if any) that caused signature help to be triggered
    if (context.triggerCharacter) { parts.push(context.triggerCharacter) }

    // Was signature help already showing when it was triggered again?
    if (context.isRetrigger) { parts.push('retrigger') }

    return parts.join(' ');
}
```

Additionally, SignatureHelpProviders can now be registered with a distinct set of trigger characters and re-trigger characters. Re-trigger characters only trigger signature help if is already showing.

Here's the above SignatureHelpProvider in action:

![The above signature help provider in action](images/1_30/api-sighelp-context.gif)

### Configuring contributed TypeScript server plugins

Extensions can now send configuration data to [contributed typescript server plugins](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensionAPI/extension-points#_contributestypescriptserverplugins) through an API provided by VS Code's built-in TypeScript extension:

```typescript
// In your VS Code extension

export async function activate(context: vscode.ExtensionContext) {
    // Get the TS extension
    const tsExtension = vscode.extensions.gettsExtension('vscode.typescript-language-features');
    if (!tsExtension) {
        return;
    }

    await tsExtension.activate();

    // Get the API from the TS extension
    if (!tsExtension.exports || !tsExtension.exports.getAPI) {
        return;
    }

    const api = tsExtension.exports.getAPI(0);
    if (!api) {
        return;
    }

    // Configure the 'my-typescript-plugin-id' plugin
    api.configurePlugin('my-typescript-plugin-id', {
        someValue: process.env['SOME_VALUE']
    });
}
```

The TypeScript server plugin receives the configuration data through an `onConfigurationChanged` method:

```typescript
// In your TypeScript plugin

import * as ts_module from 'typescript/lib/tsserverlibrary';

export = function init({ typescript }: { typescript: typeof ts_module }) {
    return {
        create(info: ts.server.PluginCreateInfo) {
            // Create new language service
        },
        onConfigurationChanged(config: any) {
            // Receive configuration changes sent from VS Code
        },
    };
};
```

This API allows VS Code extensions to synchronize VS Code settings with a TypeScript server plugin, or dynamically change the behavior of a plugin. Take a look at the [TypeScript TSLint plugin](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-typescript-tslint-plugin/blob/master/src/index.ts) and [lit-html](https://github.com/mjbvz/vscode-lit-html/blob/master/src/index.ts) extensions to see how this API is used in practice.

### Custom views

The proposed API for adding a **Collapse All** action to your view is now stable.

**Tree Item Description**

You can now add a description to your tree item using the `description` property in `TreeItem`. If the tree item is backed by a resource, you can also let VS Code derive the description from the resource by setting `description` to `true`.

```typescript
/**
 * A human readable string which is rendered less prominently.
 * When `true`, it is derived from [resourceUri](#TreeItem.resourceUri), and when `falsy`, it is not shown.
 */
description?: string | boolean;
```

![Tree Item Description](images/1_30/treeitem-description.png)

### Debugging API

**Richer DebugSession**

The [`DebugSession`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/a152a5c7818a13666a5879b4450eb26a4d45fbde/src/vs/vscode.d.ts#L8310) API now surfaces the workspace folder and the **resolved** debug configuration. Resolved means that all variables have been substituted and platform specific attribute sections have been "flattened" for the matching platform and removed for non-matching platforms.

**Unique ID for breakpoints**

The [`Breakpoint`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/a152a5c7818a13666a5879b4450eb26a4d45fbde/src/vs/vscode.d.ts#L8576) class now surfaces a unique ID (`id`) that doesn't change over its entire lifetime.

**Finalized API for controlling debug adapter creation**

In this milestone, we have finalized the extension API for controlling the creation of debug adapters. The API uses a new [`DebugAdapterDescriptorFactory`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/a152a5c7818a13666a5879b4450eb26a4d45fbde/src/vs/vscode.d.ts#L8471) which must be registered for a specific debug type with [`vscode.debug.registerDebugAdapterDescriptorFactory`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/a152a5c7818a13666a5879b4450eb26a4d45fbde/src/vs/vscode.d.ts#L8702). The factory has a single method `createDebugAdapterDescriptor` which is called by VS Code whenever a debug adapter is needed. Since the debug session is passed as an argument (and the session now surfaces both the workspace folder and the resolved configuration), the implementation has access to the full context when being asked to create the debug adapter. `createDebugAdapterDescriptor` must return an object that describes to VS Code how to create and/or connect to the debug adapter:

* A `DebugAdapterExecutable` descriptor makes VS Code launch the debug adapter as an external process per session and communicate with it through stdin/stdout. An options property bag can specify the working directory and environment variables.
* A `DebugAdapterServer` makes VS Code connect to a server process that handles multiple sessions and communicates via a socket.

Please note: With the finalization of this API, we are deprecating the old (proposed) API [`DebugConfigurationProvider.debugAdapterExecutable`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/a152a5c7818a13666a5879b4450eb26a4d45fbde/src/vs/vscode.proposed.d.ts#L547) and the very old command-based approach (contribution point `Debuggers`, attribute: `adapterExecutableCommand`). Please move off those APIs as we plan to remove support for them in the next release.

This snippet shows how this API can be used to run a debug adapter embedded in its containing extension:

```typescript
let server: Net.Server;
vscode.debug.registerDebugAdapterDescriptorFactory('mock', {
    createDebugAdapterDescriptor(session: DebugSession, executable: DebugAdapterExecutable) {
        // start server on launch of first debug session
        if (!server) {
            // start listening on a random port
            server = Net.createServer(socket => {
                const s = new MockDebugSession();
                s.setRunAsServer(true);
                s.start(<NodeJS.ReadableStream>socket, socket);
            }).listen(0);
        }
        // make VS Code connect to debug server instead of launching debug adapter
        return new DebugAdapterServer(server.address().port);
    }
});
```

**Finalized Debug Adapter Tracker API**

In this milestone, we have finalized the extension API for tracking the [Debug Adapter Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol/) used between VS Code and debugger extensions. The API uses a new [`DebugAdapterTrackerFactory`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/a152a5c7818a13666a5879b4450eb26a4d45fbde/src/vs/vscode.d.ts#L8522) which must be registered for a debug type with [`vscode.debug.registerDebugAdapterTrackerFactory`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/a152a5c7818a13666a5879b4450eb26a4d45fbde/src/vs/vscode.d.ts#L8711). The factory has a single method `createDebugAdapterTracker` which is called by VS Code before it starts to communicate with the debug adapter. `createDebugAdapterDescriptor` must return an implementation of an [`DebugAdapterTracker`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/a152a5c7818a13666a5879b4450eb26a4d45fbde/src/vs/vscode.d.ts#L8495) (or `undefined` to prevent tracking).

This snippet shows how this API can be used to log the Debug Adapter Protocol for the Node.js debugger:

```typescript
vscode.debug.registerDebugAdapterTrackerFactory('node', {
    createDebugAdapterTracker(session: DebugSession) {
        return {
            onWillReceiveMessage: m => console.log(`> ${JSON.stringify(m, undefined, 2)}`),
            onDidSendMessage: m => console.log(`< ${JSON.stringify(m, undefined, 2)}`),
        };
    }
});
```

 To ensure that the extension is activated when needed, an activation event `onDebugAdapterProtocolTracker:<debug type>` can be used in the `package.json`. If the debug type is omitted the extension is activated for all debug types.

```json
{
    "activationEvents": [
        "onDebugAdapterProtocolTracker:node"
    ]
}
```

### Debug Adapter Protocol

**New `shellProcessId` attribute for `runInTerminal` response**

If a debug adapter needs to run a target in a terminal, it can use the DAP `runInTerminal` request. This request can optionally return the `processId` of the target process but in practice no frontend implementation has been able to supply this information. For this reason, we have introduced a new attribute `shellProcessId` for returning the process ID of the terminal shell (which is much simpler to determine).

### Clipboard

The clipboard API has been finalized and can now be used by all extensions. It allows extensions to copy and paste strings to the OS clipboard.

### Completion items

When inserting a completion item that spans multiple lines, VS Code adjusts the indentation. This is not always wanted and therefore we added `vscode.CompletionItem.keepWhitespace` to control this behavior.

### Labels for symbol providers

When registering a document symbol provider, a label (`DocumentSymbolProviderMetadata`) can now be provided. This label will be shown in breadcrumbs and the Outline view when a document has multiple symbol providers.

## Proposed Extension APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always we are keen on your feedback. This is what you have to do to try out a proposed API:

* You must use Insiders because proposed APIs change frequently.
* You must have this line in the `package.json` file of your extension: `"enableProposedApi": true`.
* Copy the latest version of the [`vscode.proposed.d.ts`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/vscode.proposed.d.ts) file into your project.

Note that you cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. We may likely make breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.

### Custom views support message text

**Tree view message**

You can now set a message in your tree view using the `message` property in `TreeView`.

```typescript
/**
 * An optional human-readable message that will be rendered in the view.
 */
message?: string | MarkdownString;
```

![Tree View Message](images/1_30/treeview-message.png)

### Smart select and extensions

We have added a proposed API to support the smart select feature. Today, when you run the **Expand Select** or **Shrink Select** command, selections ranges are computed based on a weak heuristic. While we are working to improve that heuristic, we also want to get extension authors involved. Therefore, we have added a proposed API for a [`SelectionRangeProvider`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/86571ec5a50b5bce09db45f458b407b77a33674a/src/vs/vscode.proposed.d.ts#L21-L34).

## Engineering

### WinJS-Promise removal

When VS Code started, JavaScript wasn't what it is today. For instance, there was no [native promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) and back then the team decided to use `WinJS.Promise`. Fast forwarding to today, the situation is different: native promises are real and `WinJS.Promise` is obsolete.

Because of that, we are in the progress of migrating away from `WinJS.Promise`. This is no easy undertaking because of differences in the API and the runtime behavior. We have started at around 10000 references to `WinJS.Promise` and are down to 1471, of which ~500 are instantiations and not plain type annotation. We are confident we will finish this epic journey soon!

### Continued Electron 3.0 exploration

During this milestone, we continued to explore bundling Electron 3.0.0 into VS Code. This is a major Electron release and comes with Chrome 66 and Node.js 10.x (a major leap forward compared to our current version that has Chrome 61 and Node.js 8.x). We plan to push out the update to our Insiders users in December to gather additional feedback. If you are interested in helping out, make sure to install VS Code [Insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders).

### Community issue tracking

The community has helped us out periodically with issue tracking for a very long time. As we see more and more issues being filed (currently at an average of 70 per day), we have started to invite the community members that are most active to [add specific labels](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/wiki/Community-Issue-Tracking) to the issues they are working on. Since GitHub doesn't have fine-grained permissions, we are using our issue bot to pick up on certain comments and add the labels for them. See the [Thank you](#thank-you) section below for acknowledgments.

### Strict Null Checking

Our work to [strict null check the main VS Code codebase](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/60565) has continued. We are now strict null checking around 800 files, and will continuing with this work until the entire codebase is covered.

You can track this engineering effort and learn more about the process [issue #60565](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/60565).

## Contributions to Extensions

Our team maintains or contributes to a number of VS Code extensions. Most notably this month:

### GitHub Pull Requests

This milestone we worked on improvements to the [GitHub Pull Requests](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github) extension.

Below are some of the new features:

* Create pull requests directly from your local branch.
* Suggest a series of source code changes on a checked out pull request.
* View status check information on the pull request description page.

You can read the full release notes for the extension at [vscode-pull-request-github releases](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-pull-request-github/releases).
