## Containers (version 0.194.x)

### Offer to add CLI to system path on macOS

The **Dev Containers: Install devcontainer CLI** command now offers to add the CLI to the `/usr/local/bin` folder. Previously the CLI was only added to `~/bin` or `~/.local/bin` if one of these folders existed and was on the `PATH`.
