When starting a Tunnel, you are prompted to select the authentication method you'd like to use, then you will be asked to pick the authentication method the first time you connect to a Tunnel.

## Dev Containers

### Connect to Dev Containers over SSH and Tunnels on Windows

You can now also connect through remote Windows machines using Tunnels or SSH to connect to Dev Containers. Previously only Linux and macOS were supported as the remote OS.
