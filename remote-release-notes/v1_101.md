## SSH

### Pre-connection Script

A new `setting(remote.SSH.preconnect)` setting lets you specify a script to run _before_ the extension establishes an SSH connection. This helps automate preparation tasks like:

* Certificate renewal
* Authentication setup
* Environment validation

The setting is configurable in two ways:

* As a single string to use the same script for all hosts
* As an object with per-host configuration

On Windows, provide a PowerShell (`.ps1`) script, and on macOS/Linux, provide an executable shell (`.sh`) script.

The script output is visible in the **Remote - SSH** section of the **Output** panel.  User approval is required whenever script contents are modified.

#### Example: SSH via Azure Bastion with AAD Authentication

[`@sanelson`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-remote-release/issues/7179#issuecomment-2849603475) has shared on GitHub how to leverage the preconnect script to authenticate through Azure Bastion with Azure Active Directory:

The preconnect script handles the authentication flow before VS Code attempts the SSH connection. For more details see [this GitHub comment](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-remote-release/issues/7179#issuecomment-2941689488).

### Remote Explorer improvements

The Remote Explorer view now supports displaying SSH hosts in their collapsed state automatically. This may be useful for users with many SSH hosts. This behavior can be configured with the `setting(remote-explorer.collapseRecentFolders)` setting.
