### Optional Paths for Templates

[Dev Container Template](https://containers.dev/templates) authors may now publish additional metadata onto dev container Templates that defines ['optional paths'](https://github.com/devcontainers/spec/blob/e2d850e48292b19b8beb3575b7e538a7bfdad981/docs/specs/devcontainer-templates.md#the-optionalpaths-property).

For example, a Template author may want to let a user choose to include/exclude starter code or platform-specific files.

The Dev Containers extension will prompt users to select which files or directories should be included when applying the Template.

### **Feedback Wanted**: Expanded compatibility for remote OSs

Effort has been made this iteration to make it possible to use the `Remote - SSH` extension with historically unsupported remote machines.

Changes include removing the requirement for 'bash' and supporting the "busybox" array of programs.

This change is experimental and subject to change.  We encourage users try connecting to previously unsupported servers and [providing feedback](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-remote-release/issues/new).

Note the <a href="vscode://settings/remote.SSH.useExecServer" codesetting="true">`useExecServer`</a> setting must be enabled and [VS Code server dependencies like `libstdc`](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/linux#_remote-host-container-wsl-linux-prerequisites) are still required.
