# January 2025 (version 1.97)

## Remote - SSH

Remote - SSH `0.117.0` will be released alongside VS Code `1.97`.

### Chat Participant Improvements

Various improvements were made to the `@remote-ssh` Chat Paricipant [introduced last release](./v1_96.md#the-remote-ssh-chat-participant).

We are continuing to improve this experience and would love to [hear your feedback](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-remote-release).

### SSH Configuration Improvements

 This release improves SSH configuration file parsing and performance. Notably, users with many `Match` statements in their SSH configurations may see a noticeable performance improvement.

### New Default Extension Setting

A new setting has been introduced to install extensions into a remote if that extension is already present locally. This mirrors the setting already available in the Dev Containers extension.

Configure with `setting(remote.SSH.defaultExtensionsIfInstalledLocally)`.

### Migration path for linux legacy server users

We are fast approaching the end of support for [Linux legacy server](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/faq/old-linux). VS Code release v1.98 (February 2025) will be the last release that supports these servers. As of release 1.99, you can no longer connect to these servers.

We have explored an option for the SSH extension where you provide a custom build of glibc and libstdc++ that enables connecting to the server. More details on this option is documented in this [draft](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/pull/7953/files) with test builds available [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pull/235232#issuecomment-2615764717).

This workaround should provide additional time for migrating to a supported Linux distro, without having to disable VS Code updates. If you have any feedback on the workaround flow, comment [on this VS Code issue](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/231623).
