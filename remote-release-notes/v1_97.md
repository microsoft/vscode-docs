# January 2025 (version 1.97)

## Remote - SSH

Remote - SSH `0.117.0` will be released alongside VS Code `1.97`.

### Chat Participant Improvements

Various improvements were made to the `@remote-ssh` Chat Paricipant [introduced last release](./v1_96.md#the-remote-ssh-chat-participant).

We are continuing to improve this experience and would love to [hear your feedback](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-remote-release).

### SSH Configuration Improvements

 This release improves SSH configuration file parsing and performance. Notably, users with many `Match` statements in their SSH configurations may see a noticeable performance improvement.

### New Default Extension Setting

A new setting has been introduced to install extensions into a remote if that extension is already present locally. This mirrors the setting already available in the Dev Containers extension.

Configure with `setting(remote.SSH.defaultExtensionsIfInstalledLocally)`.

### Migration path for Linux legacy server

We are fast approaching the end of support for [Linux legacy server](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/faq/old-linux). VS Code release v1.98 (February 2025) will be the last release that supports Linux servers with glibc < 2.28 or libstdc++ < 3.4.25. As of release 1.99, you can no longer connect to these servers.

We are considering providing a workaround option for the SSH extension where you provide a custom build of glibc and libstdc++ that enables connecting to the server. More details can be found in this [draft](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/pull/7953/files) with test builds available [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pull/235232#issuecomment-2615764717).

This workaround should provide additional time for migrating to a supported Linux distro, without having to disable VS Code updates. Please give us feedback [on this VS Code issue](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/231623).
