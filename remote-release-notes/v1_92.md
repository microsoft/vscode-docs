# July 2024 (version 1.92)

## Dev Containers

### GPG keyboxd support

The GPG forwarding for Dev Containers now supports when GPG's new `keyboxd` service for public keys is used by the local machine, the container or both.

## SSH

### Local Port Range Configuration

The usable range of local ports is now configurable with the <a href="vscode://settings/remote.SSH.preferredLocalPortRange">`remote.SSH.preferredLocalPortRange`</a> setting.  This may be useful in cases where a range of local ports is reserved on a machine but not yet bound.

Each port will be tested sequentially until an available one is found.  If no local ports in the range are available, the connection will terminate.

### Improved Windows ARM support

Fixes a bug that prevented connections to remote ARM-based Windows machines.

### Permit PTY Allocation

Users with remote connection issues now have the ability to omit the '-T' flag from the generated `ssh` connection command.  This feature is enabled with the <a href="vscode://settings/remote.SSH.permitPtyAllocation" codesetting="true">`remote.SSH.permitPtyAllocation`</a> setting.

This setting is a reported workaround for various issues.  For more information, see [the original issue](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-remote-release/issues/7558).

### Ignore `curlrc` and `wgetrc` files by default

Execution of `curl` and `wget` within the extension's bootstrapping script now ignores the default configuration files on the remote providing greater consistency and reliability. 

If the previous behavior is relied upon (eg: for proxy configuration), enable the <a href="vscode://settings/remote.SSH.useCurlAndWgetConfigurationFiles" codesetting="true">`remote.SSH.useCurlAndWgetConfigurationFiles`</a> setting.
