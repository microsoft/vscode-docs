## SSH

### SSH reconnection grace time control

A new `--reconnection-grace-time` flag keeps the remote server running beyond the default three-hour window, and the `setting(remote.SSH.reconnectionGraceTime)` setting lets you configure the grace period per host from the SSH extension. Until the grace time expires, the server will continue to stay alive on the remote machine.
