# Extension Capabilities

The whole section of "Extension Capabilities" serves one purpose: **Tell people what they can do with extensions**. Topics here should be pointers to various resources instead of specific code guides.

It should make some overall distinction between what is and isn't "language features", and direct people to "Language Extensions" section for extension authors interested in writing language extensions.
