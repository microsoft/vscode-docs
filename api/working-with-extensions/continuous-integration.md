# Continuous Integration

Extension integration tests can be run on CI services. The [`@vscode/test-electron`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-test) library helps you set up extension tests on CI providers and contains a [sample extension](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-test/tree/main/sample) setup on Azure Pipelines. You can check out the [build pipeline](https://dev.azure.com/vscode/vscode-test/_build?definitionId=15) or jump directly to the [`azure-pipelines.yml` file](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-test/blob/main/sample/azure-pipelines.yml).

## Automated publishing

You can also configure the CI to publish a new version of the extension automatically.

The publish command is similar to publishing from a local environment using [`vsce`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-vsce), but you must somehow provide the Personal Access Token (PAT) in a secure way. By storing the PAT as a `VSCE_PAT` **secret variable**, `vsce` will be able to use it. Secret variables are never exposed, so they are safe to use in a CI pipeline.

## Azure Pipelines

<a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/services/devops/"><img alt="Azure Pipelines" src="/assets/api/working-with-extensions/continuous-integration/pipelines-logo.png" width="318" /></a>

[Azure Pipelines](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/devops/pipelines/) is great for running VS Code extension tests as it supports running the tests on Windows, macOS, and Linux. For Open Source projects, you get unlimited minutes and 10 free parallel jobs. This section explains how to set up an Azure Pipelines for running your extension tests.

First, create a free account on [Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/devops/) and create an [Azure DevOps project](https://azure.microsoft.com/features/devops-projects/) for your extension.

Then, add the following `azure-pipelines.yml` file to the root of your extension's repository. Other than the `xvfb` setup script for Linux that is necessary to run VS Code in headless Linux CI machines, the definition is straight-forward:

```yaml
trigger:
  branches:
    include:
    - main
  tags:
    include:
    - v*

strategy:
  matrix:
    linux:
      imageName: 'ubuntu-latest'
    mac:
      imageName: 'macos-latest'
    windows:
      imageName: 'windows-latest'

pool:
  vmImage: $(imageName)

steps:

- task: NodeTool@0
  inputs:
    versionSpec: '10.x'
  displayName: 'Install Node.js'

- bash: |
    /usr/bin/Xvfb :99 -screen 0 1024x768x24 > /dev/null 2>&1 &
    echo ">>> Started xvfb"
  displayName: Start xvfb
  condition: and(succeeded(), eq(variables['Agent.OS'], 'Linux'))

- bash: |
    echo ">>> Compile vscode-test"
    yarn && yarn compile
    echo ">>> Compiled vscode-test"
    cd sample
    echo ">>> Run sample integration test"
    yarn && yarn compile && yarn test
  displayName: Run Tests
  env:
    DISPLAY: ':99.0'
```

Finally, [create a new pipeline](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/create-first-pipeline) in your DevOps project and point it to the `azure-pipelines.yml` file. Trigger a build and voilà:

![pipelines](images/continuous-integration/pipelines.png)

You can enable the build to run continuously when pushing to a branch and even on pull requests. See [Build pipeline triggers](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/build/triggers) to learn more.

### Azure Pipelines automated publishing

1. Set up `VSCE_PAT` as a secret variable using the [Azure DevOps secrets instructions](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/process/variables?tabs=classic%2Cbatch#secret-variables).
2. Install `vsce` as a `devDependencies` (`npm install @vscode/vsce --save-dev` or `yarn add @vscode/vsce --dev`).
3. Declare a `deploy` script in `package.json` without the PAT (by default, `vsce` will use the `VSCE_PAT` environment variable as the Personal Access Token).

```json
"scripts": {
  "deploy": "vsce publish --yarn"
}
```

4. Configure the CI so the build will also run when tags are created:

```yaml
trigger:
  branches:
    include:
    - main
  tags:
    include:
    - refs/tags/v*
```

5. Add a `publish` step in `azure-pipelines.yml` that calls `yarn deploy` with the secret variable.

```yaml
- bash: |
    echo ">>> Publish"
    yarn deploy
  displayName: Publish
  condition: and(succeeded(), startsWith(variables['Build.SourceBranch'], 'refs/tags/'), eq(variables['Agent.OS'], 'Linux'))
  env:
    VSCE_PAT: $(VSCE_PAT)
```

The [condition](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/process/conditions) property tells the CI to run the publish step only in certain cases.

In our example, the condition has three checks:

- `succeeded()` - Publish only if the tests pass.
- `startsWith(variables['Build.SourceBranch'], 'refs/tags/')` - Publish only if a tagged (release) build.
- `eq(variables['Agent.OS'], 'Linux')` - Include if your build runs on multiple agents (Windows, Linux, etc.). If not, remove that part of the condition.

Since `VSCE_PAT` is a secret variable, it is not immediately usable as an environment variable. Thus, we need to explicitly map the environment variable `VSCE_PAT` to the secret variable.

## GitHub Actions

You can also configure GitHub Actions to run your extension CI. In headless Linux CI machines `xvfb` is required to run VS Code, so if Linux is the current OS run the tests in an Xvfb enabled environment:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [macos-latest, ubuntu-latest, windows-latest]
    runs-on: $\{{ matrix.os }}
    steps:
    - name: Checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Install Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: 16.x
    - run: npm install
    - run: xvfb-run -a npm test
      if: runner.os == 'Linux'
    - run: npm test
      if: runner.os != 'Linux'
```

### GitHub Actions automated publishing

1. Set up `VSCE_PAT` as an encrypted secret using the [GitHub Actions secrets instructions](https://help.github.com/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository).
2. Install `vsce` as a `devDependencies` (`npm install @vscode/vsce --save-dev` or `yarn add @vscode/vsce --dev`).
3. Declare a `deploy` script in `package.json` without the PAT.

```json
"scripts": {
  "deploy": "vsce publish --yarn"
}
```

4. Configure the CI so the build will also run when tags are created:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches:
    - main
  release:
    types:
    - created
```

5. Add a `publish` job to the pipeline that calls `npm run deploy` with the secret variable.

```yaml
- name: Publish
  if: success() && startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/') && matrix.os == 'ubuntu-latest'
  run: npm run deploy
  env:
    VSCE_PAT: $\{{ secrets.VSCE_PAT }}
```

The [if](https://help.github.com/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idif) property tells the CI to run the publish step only in certain cases.

In our example, the condition has three checks:

- `success()` - Publish only if the tests pass.
- `startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/')` - Publish only if a tagged (release) build.
- `matrix.os == 'ubuntu-latest'` - Include if your build runs on multiple agents (Windows, Linux, etc.). If not, remove that part of the condition.

## GitLab CI

GitLab CI can be used to test and publish the extension in headless Docker containers. This can be done by pulling a preconfigured Docker image, or installing `xvfb` and the libraries required to run Visual Studio Code during the pipeline.

```yaml
image: node:12-buster

before_script:
  - npm install

test:
  script:
    - |
      apt update
      apt install -y libasound2 libgbm1 libgtk-3-0 libnss3 xvfb
      xvfb-run -a npm run test
```

### GitLab CI automated publishing

1. Set up `VSCE_PAT` as a masked variable using the [GitLab CI documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/README.html#mask-a-cicd-variable).
2. Install `vsce` as a `devDependencies` (`npm install @vscode/vsce --save-dev` or `yarn add @vscode/vsce --dev`).
3. Declare a `deploy` script in `package.json` without the PAT.

```json
"scripts": {
  "deploy": "vsce publish --yarn"
}
```

4. Add a `deploy` job that calls `npm run deploy` with the masked variable which will only trigger on tags.

```yaml
deploy:
  only:
    - tags
  script:
    - npm run deploy
```

## Travis CI

[`@vscode/test-electron`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-test) also includes a [Travis CI build definition](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-test/blob/main/.travis.yml). The way to define environment variables in Travis CI is different from other CI frameworks, so the `xvfb` script is also different:

```yaml
language: node_js
os:
- osx
- linux
node_js: 10

install:
- |
  if [ $TRAVIS_OS_NAME == "linux" ]; then
    export DISPLAY=':99.0'
    /usr/bin/Xvfb :99 -screen 0 1024x768x24 > /dev/null 2>&1 &
  fi
script:
- |
  echo ">>> Compile vscode-test"
  yarn && yarn compile
  echo ">>> Compiled vscode-test"
  cd sample
  echo ">>> Run sample integration test"
  yarn && yarn compile && yarn test
cache: yarn
```

### Travis CI automated publishing

1. Set up `VSCE_PAT` as an encrypted secret using the [Travis CI encryption key usage instructions](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/encryption-keys/#usage).
2. Install `vsce` as a `devDependencies` (`npm install @vscode/vsce --save-dev` or `yarn add @vscode/vsce --dev`).
3. Declare a `deploy` script in `package.json` without the PAT.

```json
"scripts": {
  "deploy": "vsce publish --yarn"
}
```

4. Add `deploy` stage that calls `npm run deploy` with the secret variable.

```yaml
deploy:
  provider: script
  script: "npm run deploy"
  skip_cleanup: true
  on:
    tags: true
```

The [deploy](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment) property tells the CI to deploy artifacts to a given provider if a set of conditions are met. The deploy stage does not get triggered on pull requests

In our example, the condition that is checked:

- `tags: true` - Publish only if the build is triggered from a git tag (releast)
- `skip_cleanup: true` - Prevents travis from removing any files created during the build that may be needed for deployment.

## Common questions

### Do I need to use Yarn for continuous integration?

All of the above examples refer to a hypothetical project built with [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), but can be adapted to use [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), [Grunt](https://gruntjs.com/), [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/), or any other JavaScript build tool.
