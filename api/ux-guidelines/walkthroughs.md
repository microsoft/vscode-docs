# Walkthroughs

Walkthroughs provide a consistent experience for onboarding users to an extension via a multi-step checklist featuring rich content.

**✔️ Do**

- Use helpful images to add context to the current Walkthrough step.
- Make sure images work across different color themes. Use SVGs with VS Code's [Theme Colors](/api/references/theme-color) if possible.
- Provide actions (for example, View all Commands) for each step. Use verbs where possible.

❌ Don't

- Add an excessive number of steps in a single walkthrough
- Add multiple walkthroughs unless absolutely necessary
