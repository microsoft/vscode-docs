# Settings

[Settings](/api/references/contribution-points#contributes.configuration) are how a user can configure your extension. Settings can be inputs boxes, booleans, dropdowns, lists, key/value pairs. If your extension requires the user to configure specific settings, you can open the Settings UI and query your extension setting via the setting ID.

**✔️ Do**

* Add default values to each setting
* Add clear descriptions to each setting
* Link to documentation for complicated settings
* Link to additional settings that are related
* Link to setting IDs when needing the user to configure specific settings

❌ Don't

* Create your own settings page/webview
* Create long descriptions
