# Editor Actions

[Editor actions](/api/references/contribution-points#contributes.commands) can appear in the editor toolbar. You can either add an icon as a quick action or add menu item under the overflow menu (**...**).

**✔️ Do**

* Show only when contextually appropriate
* Use icons from the icon library
* Use the overflow menu for secondary actions

❌ Don't

* Add more than one icon
* Add custom colors
* Use emojis

*This example from the GitHub Pull Requests and Issues extension opens a diff view and only shows on files with changes.*
