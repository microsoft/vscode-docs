# Activity Bar

The Activity Bar is a core navigation surface in VS Code. Extensions can contribute [View Containers](/api/ux-guidelines/views#view-containers) to the Activity Bar that appear as Activity Bar Items. Users can drag the item to other locations like the Panel to customize their layout.

**✔️ Do**

- Use an icon that matches the default Activity Bar item icon style
- Use a clear, obvious name for the [View Container](/api/ux-guidelines/views#view-containers) associated with the item

**❌ Don't**

- Duplicate an existing icon
- Use an Activity Bar item to open a Webview Panel
