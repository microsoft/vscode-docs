# Command Palette

The [Command Palette](/api/references/contribution-points#contributes.commands) is where all Commands are found. It's important that your command names are labeled appropriately so users can easily find them.

**✔️ Do**

* Add keyboard shortcuts where appropriate
* Use clear names for commands
* Group commands together in the same category

❌ Don't

* Overwrite existing keyboard shortcuts
* Use emojis in command names

*This example features commands each displaying a clear `category` prefix, for example "GitHub Issues".*
