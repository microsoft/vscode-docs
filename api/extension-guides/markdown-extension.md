# Markdown Extension

Markdown extensions allow you to extend and enhance Visual Studio Code's built-in Markdown preview. This includes changing the look of the preview or adding support for new Markdown syntax.

## Changing the look of the Markdown preview with CSS

Extensions can contribute CSS to change the look or layout of the Markdown preview. Stylesheets are registered using the `markdown.previewStyles` [Contribution Point](/api/references/contribution-points) in the extension's `package.json`:

```json
"contributes": {
    "markdown.previewStyles": [
        "./style.css"
    ]
}
```

`"markdown.previewStyles"` is a list of files relative to the extension's root folder.

Contributed styles are added after the built-in Markdown preview styles but before a user's `"markdown.styles"`.

The [Markdown Preview GitHub Styling](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.markdown-preview-github-styles) extension is a good example that demonstrates using a stylesheet to make the Markdown preview look like GitHub's rendered Markdown. You can review the extension's source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/mjbvz/vscode-github-markdown-preview-style).

## Adding support for new syntax with markdown-it plugins

The VS Code Markdown preview supports the [CommonMark specification](https://spec.commonmark.org). Extensions can add support for additional Markdown syntax by contributing a [markdown-it plugin.](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it#syntax-extensions)

To contribute a markdown-it plugin, first add a `"markdown.markdownItPlugins"` contribution in your extension's `package.json`:

```json
"contributes": {
    "markdown.markdownItPlugins": true
}
```

Then, in the extension's main `activation` function, return an object with a function named `extendMarkdownIt`. This function takes the current markdown-it instance and must return a new markdown-it instance:

```ts
import * as vscode from 'vscode';

export function activate(context: vscode.ExtensionContext) {
  return {
    extendMarkdownIt(md: any) {
      return md.use(require('markdown-it-emoji'));
    }
  };
}
```

To contribute multiple markdown-it plugins, return multiple `use` statements chained together:

```ts
return md.use(require('markdown-it-emoji')).use(require('markdown-it-hashtag'));
```

Extensions that contribute markdown-it plugins are activated lazily, when a Markdown preview is shown for the first time.

The [markdown-emoji](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.markdown-emoji) extension demonstrates using a markdown-it plugin to add emoji support to the markdown preview. You can review the Emoji extension's source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/mjbvz/vscode-markdown-emoji).

## Adding advanced functionality with scripts

For advanced functionality, extensions may contribute scripts that are executed inside of the Markdown preview.

```json
"contributes": {
    "markdown.previewScripts": [
        "./main.js"
    ]
}
```

Contributed scripts are loaded asynchronously and reloaded on every content change.

The [Markdown Preview Mermaid Support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.markdown-mermaid) extension demonstrates using scripts to add [mermaid](https://knsv.github.io/mermaid/index.html) diagrams and flowchart support to the markdown preview. You can review the Mermaid extension's source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/mjbvz/vscode-markdown-mermaid).
