# Built-in Commands

This document lists a subset of Visual Studio Code commands that you might use with `vscode.commands.executeCommand` API.

Read the [Commands guide](/api/extension-guides/command) for how to use the commands API.

The following is a sample of how to open a new folder in VS Code:

```javascript
let uri = Uri.file('/some/path/to/folder');
let success = await commands.executeCommand('vscode.openFolder', uri);
```

>**Note**: You can review the full set of VS Code commands via the Keyboard Shortcuts editor **File** > **Preferences** > **Keyboard Shortcuts** (on macOS **Code** > **Preferences** > **Keyboard Shortcuts**). The Keyboard Shortcuts editor lists all commands built into VS Code or contributed by extensions, along with their keybindings and visibility when clauses.
