# when clause contexts

Visual Studio Code sets various context keys and specific values depending on what elements are visible and active in the VS Code UI. These contexts can be used to selectively enable or disable extension commands and UI elements, such as menus and views.

For example, VS Code uses when clauses to enable or disable command keybindings, which you can see in the Default Keybindings JSON (**Preferences: Open Default Keyboard Shortcuts (JSON)**):

```json
{ "key": "f5",  "command": "workbench.action.debug.start",
                   "when": "debuggersAvailable && !inDebugMode" },
```

Above the built-in **Start Debugging** command has the keyboard shortcut `kb(workbench.action.debug.start)`, which is only enabled when there is an appropriate debugger available (context `debuggersAvailable` is true) and the editor isn't in debug mode (context `inDebugMode` is false).

## Conditional operators

For conditional expressions, you can use the following conditional operators:

Operator | Symbol | Example
-------- | ------ | -----
Equality | `==` | `"editorLangId == typescript"`
Inequality | `!=` | `"resourceExtname != .js"`
Or | <code>\|\|</code> | `"isLinux`<code>\|\|</code>`isWindows"`
And | `&&` | `"textInputFocus && !editorReadonly"`
Not | `!` | `!editorReadonly`
Matches | `=~` | `"resourceScheme =~ /^untitled$\|^file$/"`
Greater than | `>` `>=` | `"gitOpenRepositoryCount >= 1"`
Less than | `<` `<=` | `"workspaceFolderCount < 2"`
In | `in` | `resourceFilename in supportedFolders` ([details](#in-conditional-operator) below)

### key-value when clause operator

There is a key-value pair match operator for `when` clauses. The expression `key =~ value` treats the right-hand side as a regular expression to match against the left-hand side. For example, to contribute context menu items for all Docker files, one could use:

```json
   "when": "resourceFilename =~ /docker/"
```

## Available contexts

Below are some of the available `when` clause contexts, which evaluate to Boolean true/false.

The list here isn't exhaustive and you can find other `when` clause contexts by searching and filtering in the Keyboard Shortcuts editor (**Preferences: Open Keyboard Shortcuts**) or reviewing the Default Keybindings JSON file (**Preferences: Open Default Keyboard Shortcuts (JSON)**).

## Active/focused view or panel when clause context

You can have a when clause that checks if a specific view or panel is visible.

Context name | True when
------------ | ------------
activeViewlet | True when view is visible. Example: `"activeViewlet == 'workbench.view.explorer'"`
activePanel | True when panel is visible. Example: `"activePanel == 'workbench.panel.output'"`
focusedView | True when view is focused. Example: `"focusedView == myViewsExplorerID"`

View Identifiers:

* workbench.view.explorer - File Explorer
* workbench.view.search - Search
* workbench.view.scm - Source Control
* workbench.view.debug - Run
* workbench.view.extensions - Extensions

Panel Identifiers:

* workbench.panel.markers - Problems
* workbench.panel.output - Output
* workbench.panel.repl - Debug Console
* terminal - Integrated Terminal
* workbench.panel.comments - Comments
* workbench.view.search - Search when `search.location` is set to `panel`

If you want a when clause that is enabled only when a specific view or panel has focus, use `sideBarFocus` or `panelFocus` in combination with `activeViewlet` or `activePanel`.

For example, the when clause below is true only when the File Explorer has focus:

```json
"sideBarFocus && activeViewlet == 'workbench.view.explorer'"
```

## Check a setting in a when clause

In a when clause, you can reference a configuration (setting) value by prefixing it with `config.`, for example `config.editor.tabCompletion` or `config.breadcrumbs.enabled`.

## Add a custom when clause context

If you are authoring your own VS Code extension and need to enable/disable commands, menus, or views by using a `when` clause context and none of the existing keys suit your needs, you can add your own context with the `setContext` command.

The first example below sets the key `myExtension.showMyCommand` to true, which you can use in enablement of commands or with the `when` property. The second example stores a value that you could use with a `when` clause to check if the number of cool open things is greater than 2.

```js
vscode.commands.executeCommand('setContext', 'myExtension.showMyCommand', true);

vscode.commands.executeCommand('setContext', 'myExtension.numberOfCoolOpenThings', 4);
```

## 'in' and 'not in' conditional operators

The `in` operator for `when` clauses allows for a dynamic lookup of a context key's value within another context key's value. For example, if you wanted to add a context menu command to folders that contain a certain type of file (or something that can't be statically known), you can now use the `in` operator to achieve it. You can use the `not in` operator to check the opposite condition.

First, determine which folders should support the command, and the folder name to an array. Then, use the `setContext` command to turn the array into a context key:

```ts
vscode.commands.executeCommand('setContext', 'ext.supportedFolders', [ 'test', 'foo', 'bar' ]);

// or

// Note in this case (using an object), the value doesn't matter, it is based on the existence of the key in the object
// The value must be of a simple type
vscode.commands.executeCommand('setContext', 'ext.supportedFolders', { 'test': true, 'foo': 'anything', 'bar': false });
```

Then, in the `package.json` you could add a menu contribution for the `explorer/context` menu:

```json
// Note, this assumes you have already defined a command called ext.doSpecial
"menus": {
  "explorer/context": [
    {
      "command": "ext.doSpecial",
      "when": "explorerResourceIsFolder && resourceFilename in ext.supportedFolders"
    }
  ]
}
```

In that example, we are taking the value of `resourceFilename` (which is the name of the folder in this case) and checking for its existence in the value of `ext.supportedFolders`. If it exists, the menu will be shown. This powerful operator should allow for richer conditional and dynamic contributions that support `when` clauses, for example menus, views, etc.

## Inspect Context Keys utility

If you'd like to see all currently active context keys at runtime, you can use the **Developer: Inspect Context Keys** command from the Command Palette (`kb(workbench.action.showCommands)`). **Inspect Context Keys** will display context keys and their values in the VS Code Developer Tools **Console** tab (**Help** > **Toggle Developer Tools**).

When you run **Developer: Inspect Context Keys**, your cursor will highlight elements in the VS Code UI and when you click on an element, the current context keys and their states will be output as an object to the Console.

![Inspect Context Keys output](images/when-clause-contexts/inspect-context-keys.png)

The list of active context keys is extensive and may contain [custom context keys](#add-a-custom-when-clause-context) from extensions you have installed.

>**Note**: Some context keys are for VS Code internal use and may change in the future.
