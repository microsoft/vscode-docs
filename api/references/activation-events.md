# Activation Events

**Activation Events** is a set of JSON declarations that you make in the `activationEvents` field of `package.json` [Extension Manifest](/api/references/extension-manifest). Your extension becomes activated when the **Activation Event** happens. Here is a list of all available **Activation Events**:

- [`onLanguage`](/api/references/activation-events#onLanguage)
- [`onCommand`](/api/references/activation-events#onCommand)
- [`onDebug`](/api/references/activation-events#onDebug)
  - [`onDebugInitialConfigurations`](/api/references/activation-events#onDebugInitialConfigurations)
  - [`onDebugResolve`](/api/references/activation-events#onDebugResolve)
- [`workspaceContains`](/api/references/activation-events#workspaceContains)
- [`onFileSystem`](/api/references/activation-events#onFileSystem)
- [`onView`](/api/references/activation-events#onView)
- [`onUri`](/api/references/activation-events#onUri)
- [`onWebviewPanel`](/api/references/activation-events#onWebviewPanel)
- [`onCustomEditor`](/api/references/activation-events#onCustomEditor)
- [`onAuthenticationRequest`](/api/references/activation-events#onAuthenticationRequest)
- [`onStartupFinished`](/api/references/activation-events#onStartupFinished)
- [`*`](/api/references/activation-events#Start-up)

We also provide a reference of all fields in the [`package.json` extension manifest](/api/references/extension-manifest).

## onLanguage

This activation event is emitted and interested extensions will be activated whenever a file that resolves to a certain language gets opened.

```json
...
"activationEvents": [
    "onLanguage:python"
]
...
```

The `onLanguage` event takes a [language identifier](/docs/languages/identifiers) value.

Multiple languages can be declared with separate `onLanguage` entries in the `activationEvents` array.

```json
"activationEvents": [
    "onLanguage:json",
    "onLanguage:markdown",
    "onLanguage:typescript"
]
...
```

> **Note**: Beginning with VS Code 1.74.0, languages contributed by your extension do not require a corresponding `onLanguage` activation event declaration for your extension to be activated.

## onCommand

This activation event is emitted and interested extensions will be activated whenever a command is being invoked:

```json
...
"activationEvents": [
    "onCommand:extension.sayHello"
]
...
```

> **Note**: Beginning with VS Code 1.74.0, commands contributed by your extension do not require a corresponding `onCommand` activation event declaration for your extension to be activated.

## onDebug

This activation event is emitted and interested extensions will be activated before a debug session is started:

```json
...
"activationEvents": [
    "onDebug"
]
...
```

These are two more fine-grained `onDebug` activation events:

### onDebugInitialConfigurations

`onDebugInitialConfigurations` is fired just before the `provideDebugConfigurations` method of the `DebugConfigurationProvider` is called.

### onDebugResolve

`onDebugResolve:type` is fired just before the `resolveDebugConfiguration` method of the `DebugConfigurationProvider` for the specified type is called.

**Rule of thumb:** If activation of a debug extension is lightweight, use `onDebug`. If it is heavyweight, use `onDebugInitialConfigurations` and/or `onDebugResolve` depending on whether the `DebugConfigurationProvider` implements the corresponding methods `provideDebugConfigurations` and/or `resolveDebugConfiguration`. See [Using a DebugConfigurationProvider](/api/extension-guides/debugger-extension#using-a-debugconfigurationprovider) for more details on these methods.

## workspaceContains

This activation event is emitted and interested extensions will be activated whenever a folder is opened and the folder contains at least one file that matches a glob pattern.

```json
...
"activationEvents": [
    "workspaceContains:**/.editorconfig"
]
...
```

## onFileSystem

This activation event is emitted and interested extensions will be activated whenever a file or folder from a specific _scheme_ is read. This is usually the `file`-scheme, but with custom file system providers more schemes come into place, e.g `ftp` or `ssh`.

```json
...
"activationEvents": [
    "onFileSystem:sftp"
]
...
```

## onView

This activation event is emitted and interested extensions will be activated whenever a view of the specified id is expanded in the VS Code sidebar (Extensions or Source Control are examples of built-in views).

The activation event below will fire whenever a view with the `nodeDependencies` id is visible:

```json
...
"activationEvents": [
    "onView:nodeDependencies"
]
...
```

> **Note**: Beginning with VS Code 1.74.0, views contributed by your extension do not require a corresponding `onView` activation event declaration for your extension to be activated.


## onUri

This activation event is emitted and interested extensions will be activated whenever a system-wide Uri for that extension is opened. The Uri scheme is fixed to either `vscode` or `vscode-insiders`. The Uri authority must be the extension's identifier. The rest of the Uri is arbitrary.

```json
...
"activationEvents": [
    "onUri"
]
...
```

If the `vscode.git` extension defines `onUri` as an activation event, it will be activated in any of the following Uris are open:

- `vscode://vscode.git/init`
- `vscode://vscode.git/clone?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FMicrosoft%2Fvscode-vsce.git`
- `vscode-insiders://vscode.git/init` (for VS Code Insiders)

## onWebviewPanel

This activation event is emitted and interested extensions will be activated whenever VS Code needs to restore a [webview](/api/extension-guides/webview) with the matching `viewType`.

For example, the declaration of `onWebviewPanel` below:

```json
"activationEvents": [
    "onWebviewPanel:catCoding"
]
```

will cause the extension to be activated when VS Code needs to restore a webview with the viewType: `catCoding`. The viewType is set in the call to `window.createWebviewPanel` and you will need to have another activation event (for example, onCommand) to initially activate your extension and create the webview.

## onCustomEditor

This activation event is emitted and interested extensions will be activated whenever VS Code needs to create a [custom editor](/api/extension-guides/custom-editors) with the matching `viewType`.

For example, the declaration of `onCustomEditor` below:

```json
"activationEvents": [
    "onCustomEditor:catCustoms.pawDraw"
]
```

will cause the extension to be activated when VS Code needs to restore a custom editor with the viewType: `catCustoms.pawDraw`. The viewType is set in the [`customEditors` contribution point](/api/extension-guides/custom-editors#contribution-point) and bound to a provider with `registerCustomEditorProvider`.

> **Note**: Beginning with VS Code 1.74.0, custom editors contributed by your extension do not require a corresponding `onCustomEditor` activation event declaration for your extension to be activated.

## onAuthenticationRequest

This activation event is emitted and interested extensions will be activated whenever an extension requests an authentication session (via the `authentication.getSession()` API) with the matching `providerId`.

For example, the declaration of `onAuthenticationRequest` below:

```json
"activationEvents": [
    "onAuthenticationRequest:github"
]
```

will cause the extension to be activated when VS Code needs retrieve an `AuthenticationSession` of type `github`.

> **Note**: Beginning with VS Code 1.74.0, authentication providers contributed by your extension do not require a corresponding `onAuthenticationRequest` activation event declaration for your extension to be activated.

## onStartupFinished

This activation event is emitted and interested extensions will be activated **some time after** VS Code starts up. This is similar to the `*` activation event, but it will not slow down VS Code startup. Currently, this event is emitted after all the `*` activated extensions have finished activating.

```json
...
"activationEvents": [
    "onStartupFinished"
]
...
```

## Start up

The `*` activation event is emitted and interested extensions will be activated whenever VS Code starts up.

> **Note:** To ensure a great user experience, please use this activation event in your extension only when no other activation events combination works in your use-case.

```json
...
"activationEvents": [
    "*"
]
...
```

> **Note:** An extension can listen to multiple activation events, and that is preferable to listening to `"*"`.

> **Note:** An extension **must** export an `activate()` function from its main module and it will be invoked **only once** by VS Code when any of the specified activation events is emitted. Also, an extension **should** export a `deactivate()` function from its main module to perform cleanup tasks on VS Code shutdown. Extension **must** return a Promise from `deactivate()` if the cleanup process is asynchronous. An extension may return `undefined` from `deactivate()` if the cleanup runs synchronously.
