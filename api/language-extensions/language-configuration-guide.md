# Language Configuration Guide

The [`contributes.languages`](/api/references/contribution-points#contributes.languages) Contribution Point allows you to define a language configuration that controls the following Declarative Language Features:

- Comment toggling
- Brackets definition
- Autoclosing
- Autosurrounding
- Folding
- Word pattern
- Indentation Rules

Here is a [Language Configuration sample](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-extension-samples/tree/main/language-configuration-sample) that configures the editing experience for JavaScript files. This guide explains the content of `language-configuration.json`:

**Note: If your language configuration file name is or ends with `language-configuration.json`, you will get autocompletion and validation in VS Code.**

```json
{
  "comments": {
    "lineComment": "//",
    "blockComment": ["/*", "*/"]
  },
  "brackets": [["{", "}"], ["[", "]"], ["(", ")"]],
  "autoClosingPairs": [
    { "open": "{", "close": "}" },
    { "open": "[", "close": "]" },
    { "open": "(", "close": ")" },
    { "open": "'", "close": "'", "notIn": ["string", "comment"] },
    { "open": "\"", "close": "\"", "notIn": ["string"] },
    { "open": "`", "close": "`", "notIn": ["string", "comment"] },
    { "open": "/**", "close": " */", "notIn": ["string"] }
  ],
  "autoCloseBefore": ";:.,=}])>` \n\t",
  "surroundingPairs": [
    ["{", "}"],
    ["[", "]"],
    ["(", ")"],
    ["'", "'"],
    ["\"", "\""],
    ["`", "`"]
  ],
  "folding": {
    "markers": {
      "start": "^\\s*//\\s*#?region\\b",
      "end": "^\\s*//\\s*#?endregion\\b"
    }
  },
  "wordPattern": "(-?\\d*\\.\\d\\w*)|([^\\`\\~\\!\\@\\#\\%\\^\\&\\*\\(\\)\\-\\=\\+\\[\\{\\]\\}\\\\\\|\\;\\:\\'\\\"\\,\\.\\<\\>\\/\\?\\s]+)",
  "indentationRules": {
    "increaseIndentPattern": "^((?!\\/\\/).)*(\\{[^}\"'`]*|\\([^)\"'`]*|\\[[^\\]\"'`]*)$",
    "decreaseIndentPattern": "^((?!.*?\\/\\*).*\\*/)?\\s*[\\}\\]].*$"
  }
}
```

## Comment toggling

VS Code offers two commands for comment toggling. **Toggle Line Comment** and **Toggle Block Comment**. You can specify `comments.blockComment` and `comments.lineComment` to control how VS Code should comment out lines / blocks.

```json
{
  "comments": {
    "lineComment": "//",
    "blockComment": ["/*", "*/"]
  }
}
```

## Brackets definition

When you move the cursor to a bracket defined here, VS Code will highlight that bracket together with its matching pair.

```json
{
  "brackets": [["{", "}"], ["[", "]"], ["(", ")"]]
}
```

Moreover, when you run **Go to Bracket** or **Select to Bracket**, VS Code will use the definition above to find the nearest bracket and its matching pair.

## Autoclosing

When you type `'`, VS Code creates a pair of single quotes and puts your cursor in the middle: `'|'`. This section defines such pairs.


```json
{
  "autoClosingPairs": [
    { "open": "{", "close": "}" },
    { "open": "[", "close": "]" },
    { "open": "(", "close": ")" },
    { "open": "'", "close": "'", "notIn": ["string", "comment"] },
    { "open": "\"", "close": "\"", "notIn": ["string"] },
    { "open": "`", "close": "`", "notIn": ["string", "comment"] },
    { "open": "/**", "close": " */", "notIn": ["string"] }
  ]
}
```

The `notIn` key disables this feature in certain code ranges. For example, when you are writing the following code:

```js
// ES6's Template String
`ES6's Template String`;
```

The single quote will not be autoclosed.

Pairs that do not require a `notIn` property can also use a simpler syntax:
```json
{
  "autoClosingPairs": [ ["{", "}"], ["[", "]"] ]
}
```


Users can tweak the autoclosing behavior with the `editor.autoClosingQuotes` and `editor.autoClosingBrackets` settings.

### Autoclosing before

By default, VS Code only autocloses pairs if there is whitespace right after the cursor. So when you type `{` in the following JSX code, you would not get autoclose:

```js
const Component = () =>
  <div className={>
                  ^ Does not get autoclosed by default
  </div>
```

However, this definition overrides that behavior:

```json
{
  "autoCloseBefore": ";:.,=}])>` \n\t"
}
```

Now when you enter `{` right before `>`, VS Code autocloses it with `}`.

## Autosurrounding

When you select a range in VS Code and enter an opening bracket, VS Code surrounds the selected content with a pair of brackets. This feature is called Autosurrounding, and here you can define the autosurrounding pairs for a specific language:

```json
{
  "surroundingPairs": [
    ["{", "}"],
    ["[", "]"],
    ["(", ")"],
    ["'", "'"],
    ["\"", "\""],
    ["`", "`"]
  ]
}
```

Users can tweak the autosurrounding behavior with the `editor.autoSurround` setting.

## Folding

In VS Code, folding is defined either indentation-based, or defined by contributed folding range providers:

- Indentation-based folding with markers: If no folding range provider is available for the given language or if the user has set `editor.foldingStrategy` to `indentation`, indentation-based folding is used. A folding region starts when a line has a smaller indent than one or more following lines, and ends when there is a line with the same or smaller indent. Empty lines are ignored.
Additionally, the language configuration can define start and end markers. These are defined as `start` and `end` regexes in `folding.markers`. When matching lines are found, a folding range inside the pair is created. Folding markers must be non-empty and typically look like `//#region` and `//#endregion`.

The following JSON creates folding markers for `//#region` and `//#endregion`.

```json
{
  "folding": {
    "markers": {
      "start": "^\\s*//\\s*#?region\\b",
      "end": "^\\s*//\\s*#?endregion\\b"
    }
  }
}
```

- Language server folding: The Language Server responds to the [`textDocument/foldingRange`](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specification#textDocument_foldingRange) request with a list of folding ranges, and VS Code would render the ranges as folding markers. Learn more about the folding support in Language Server Protocol at the [Programmatic Language Feature](/api/language-extensions/programmatic-language-features) topic.

## Word Pattern

`wordPattern` defines what's considered as a word in the programming language. Code suggestion features will use this setting to determine word boundaries if `wordPattern` is set. Note this setting won't affect word-related editor commands, which are controlled by the editor setting `editor.wordSeparators`.

```json
{
  "wordPattern": "(-?\\d*\\.\\d\\w*)|([^\\`\\~\\!\\@\\#\\%\\^\\&\\*\\(\\)\\-\\=\\+\\[\\{\\]\\}\\\\\\|\\;\\:\\'\\\"\\,\\.\\<\\>\\/\\?\\s]+)"
}
```

## Indentation Rules

`indentationRules` defines how the editor should adjust the indentation of current line or next line when you type, paste, and move lines.

```json
{
  "indentationRules": {
    "increaseIndentPattern": "^((?!\\/\\/).)*(\\{[^}\"'`]*|\\([^)\"'`]*|\\[[^\\]\"'`]*)$",
    "decreaseIndentPattern": "^((?!.*?\\/\\*).*\\*/)?\\s*[\\)\\}\\]].*$"
  }
}
```

For example, `if (true) {` matches `increaseIndentPattern`, then if you press `kbstyle(Enter)` after the open bracket `{`, the editor will automatically indent once, and your code will end up as:

```javascript
if (true) {
  console.log();
```

In addition to `increaseIndentPattern` and `decreaseIndentPatter`, there are two other indentation rules:

- `indentNextLinePattern` - If a line matches this pattern, then **only the next line** after it should be indented once.
- `unIndentedLinePattern` - If a line matches this pattern, then its indentation should not be changed and it should not be evaluated against the other rules.

If there is no indentation rule set for the programming language, the editor will indent when the line ends with an open bracket and outdent when you type a closing bracket. The bracket here is defined by `brackets`.

Notice that `editor.formatOnPaste` setting is controlled by the [`DocumentRangeFormattingEditProvider`](/api/references/vscode-api#DocumentRangeFormattingEditProvider) and not affected by auto indentation.

## On Enter Rules

`onEnterRules` defines a list of rules that will be evaluated when `kbstyle(Enter)` is pressed in the editor.

```json
{
  "onEnterRules": [{
    "beforeText": "^\\s*(?:def|class|for|if|elif|else|while|try|with|finally|except|async).*?:\\s*$",
    "action": { "indent": "indent" }
  }]
}
```

When pressing `kbstyle(Enter)`, the text before, after, or one line above the cursor is checked against the following properties:

- `beforeText` (mandatory). A regular expression that matches the text before the cursor (limited to the current line).
- `afterText`. A regular expression that matches the text after the cursor (limited to the current line).
- `previousLineText`. A regular expression that matches the text one line above the cursor.

If all the specified properties match, the rule is considered to match and no further `onEnterRules` will be evaluated. An `onEnterRule` can specify the following actions:

- `indent` (mandatory). One of `none, indent, outdent, indentOutdent`.
  - `none` means that the new line will inherit the indentation of the current line.
  - `indent` means that the new line will be indented relative to the current line.
  - `outdent` means that the new line will be unindented relative to the current line.
  - `indentOutdent` means that two new lines will be inserted, one indented and the second one outdented.
- `appendText`. A string that will be appended after the new line and after the indentation.
- `removeText`. The number of characters to remove from the new line's indentation.
