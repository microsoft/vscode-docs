# Documentation Writing Instructions

These are our documentation writing style guidelines.

## General Style tips

* Get to the point fast.
* Talk like a person.
* Simpler is better.
* Be brief. Give customers just enough information to make decisions confidently. Prune every excess word.

## Grammar

* Use present tense verbs (is, open) instead of past tense (was, opened).
* Write factual statements and direct commands. Avoid hypotheticals.
* Use active voice where the subject performs the action.
* Write in second person (you) to speak directly to readers.
* Use gender-neutral language.
* Avoid multiple -ing words that can create ambiguity.
* Keep prepositional phrases simple and clear.
* Place modifiers close to what they modify.

## Capitalization

* Use sentence-style capitalization for everything except proper nouns.
* Always capitalize proper nouns.
* Donâ€™t capitalize the spelled-out form of an acronym unless it's a proper noun.
* Use title-style capitalization for product and service names.
* In programming languages, follow the traditional capitalization of keywords and other special terms.
* Don't use all uppercase for emphasis.

## Numbers

* Spell out numbers for zero through nine, unless space is limited. Use numerals for 10 and above.
* Spell out numbers at the beginning of a sentence.
* Spell out ordinal numbers such as first, second, and third. Don't add -ly to form adverbs from ordinal numbers.

## Punctuation

* Use short, simple sentences.
* End all sentences with a period.
* Use one space after punctuation marks.
* After a colon, capitalize only proper nouns.
* Avoid semicolons - use separate sentences instead.
* Use question marks sparingly.
* Don't use slashes (/) - use "or" instead.

## Text formatting

* UI elements, like menu items, dialog names, and names of text boxes, should be in bold text.
* Use code style for:
    * Code elements, like method names, property names, and language keywords.
    * SQL commands.
    * NuGet package names.
    * Command-line commands.
    * Database table and column names.
    * Resource names (like virtual machine names) that shouldn't be localized.
    * URLs that you don't want to be selectable.
* For code placeholders, if you want users to replace part of an input string with their own values, use angle brackets (less than < and greater than > characters) on that placeholder text.
* Don't apply an inline style like italic, bold, or inline code style to headings.

## Alerts

* Alerts are a Markdown extension to create block quotes that render with colors and icons that indicate the significance of the content. The following alert types are supported:

    * `[!NOTE]` Information the user should notice even if skimming.
    * `[!TIP]` Optional information to help a user be more successful.
    * `[!IMPORTANT]` Essential information required for user success.
    * `[!CAUTION]` Negative potential consequences of an action.
    * `[!WARNING]` Dangerous certain consequences of an action.

## Links

* Links to other documentation articles should be relative, not absolute. Start relative links with `/docs/` and include the `.md` suffix.
* Links in release notes should be full URLs, not relative. Use the `https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/` domain.
* Links to bookmarks within the same article should be relative and start with `#`.
* Link descriptions should be descriptive and make sense on their own. Don't use "click here" or "this link" or "here".

## Images

* Use images only when they add value.
* Images have a descriptive and meaningful alt text that starts with "Screenshot showing" and ends with ".".
* Videos have a descriptive and meaningful alt text or title that starts with "Video showing" and ends with ".".

## Numbered steps

* Write complete sentences with capitalization and periods
* Use imperative verbs
* Clearly indicate where actions take place (UI location)
* For single steps, use a bullet instead of a number
* When allowed, use angle brackets for menu sequences (File > Open)

## Terminology

* Use "Select" instead of "Click" for UI elements like buttons, menu items, links, dropdowns, and checkboxes.
* Follow the terms and capitalization guidelines in #fetch [VS Code docs wiki](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/wiki/VS-Code-glossary)
